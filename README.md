## Installation
Installation is the next section in an effective README. Tell other users how to install your project locally. Optionally, include a gif to make the process even more clear for other people.
Also, introduction.

## Usage
The next section is usage, in which you instruct other people on how to use your project after they’ve installed it. This would also be a good place to include screenshots of your project in action.

Describe the rile formats and the software.

Describe the relations between formats and software.

## Contributing
Larger projects often have sections on contributing to their project, in which contribution instructions are outlined. Sometimes, this is a separate file. If you have specific contribution preferences, explain them so that other developers know how to best contribute to your work. To learn more about how to help others contribute, check out the guide for setting guidelines for repository contributors.

## Credits
Include a section for credits in order to highlight and link to the authors of your project.

## License
Finally, include a section for the license of your project. For more information on choosing a license, check out GitHub’s licensing guide!
