AB  - For the purpose of this review, 'time-lapse' refers to the reconstruction of 
      ancestral (in this case dinosaur) karyotypes using genome assemblies of extant 
      species. Such reconstructions are only usually possible when genomes are 
      assembled to 'chromosome level' i.e. a complete representation of all the 
      sequences, correctly ordered contiguously on each of the chromosomes. Recent 
      paleontological evidence is very clear that birds are living dinosaurs, the 
      latest example of dinosaurs emerging from a catastrophic extinction event. 
      Non-avian dinosaurs (ever present in the public imagination through art, and 
      broadcast media) emerged some 240 million years ago and have displayed incredible 
      phenotypic diversity. Here we report on our recent studies to infer the overall 
      karyotype of the Theropod dinosaur lineage from extant avian chromosome level 
      genome assemblies. Our work first focused on determining the likely karyotype of 
      the avian ancestor (most likely a chicken-sized, two-legged, feathered, land 
      dinosaur from the Jurassic period) finding karyotypic similarity to the chicken. 
      We then took the work further to determine the likely karyotype of the 
      bird-lizard ancestor and the chromosomal changes (chiefly translocations and 
      inversions) that occurred between then and modern birds. A combination of 
      bioinformatics and cross-species fluorescence in situ hybridization (zoo-FISH) 
      uncovered a considerable number of translocations and fissions from a 
      'lizard-like' genome structure of 2n = 36-46 to one similar to that of 
      soft-shelled turtles (2n = 66) from 275 to 255 million years ago (mya). 
      Remarkable karyotypic similarities between some soft-shelled turtles and chicken 
      suggests that there were few translocations from the bird-turtle ancestor (plus 
      ∼7 fissions) through the dawn of the dinosaurs and pterosaurs, through the 
      theropod linage and on to most to modern birds. In other words, an avian-like 
      karyotype was in place about 240mya when the dinosaurs and pterosaurs first 
      emerged. We mapped 49 chromosome inversions from then to the present day, 
      uncovering some gene ontology enrichment in evolutionary breakpoint regions. This 
      avian-like karyotype with its many (micro)chromosomes provides the basis for 
      variation (the driver of natural selection) through increased random segregation 
      and recombination. It may therefore contribute to the ability of dinosaurs to 
      survive multiple extinction events, emerging each time as speciose and diverse.

AB  - Extant terrestrial vertebrates, including birds, have a panoply of symbiotic 
      relationships with many insects and arachnids, such as parasitism or mutualism. 
      Yet, identifying arthropod-vertebrate symbioses in the fossil record has been 
      based largely on indirect evidence; findings of direct association between 
      arthropod guests and dinosaur host remains are exceedingly scarce. Here, we 
      present direct and indirect evidence demonstrating that beetle larvae fed on 
      feathers from an undetermined theropod host (avian or nonavian) 105 million y 
      ago. An exceptional amber assemblage is reported of larval molts (exuviae) 
      intimately associated with plumulaceous feather and other remains, as well as 
      three additional amber pieces preserving isolated conspecific exuviae. Samples 
      were found in the roughly coeval Spanish amber deposits of El Soplao, San Just, 
      and Peñacerrada I. Integration of the morphological, systematic, and taphonomic 
      data shows that the beetle larval exuviae, belonging to three developmental 
      stages, are most consistent with skin/hide beetles (family Dermestidae), an 
      ecologically important group with extant keratophagous species that commonly 
      inhabit bird and mammal nests. These findings show that a symbiotic relationship 
      involving keratophagy comparable to that of beetles and birds in current 
      ecosystems existed between their Early Cretaceous relatives.

AB  - A predominantly fish-eating diet was envisioned for the sail-backed theropod 
      dinosaur Spinosaurus aegyptiacus when its elongate jaws with subconical teeth 
      were unearthed a century ago in Egypt. Recent discovery of the high-spined tail 
      of that skeleton, however, led to a bolder conjecture that S. aegyptiacus was the 
      first fully aquatic dinosaur. The 'aquatic hypothesis' posits that S. aegyptiacus 
      was a slow quadruped on land but a capable pursuit predator in coastal waters, 
      powered by an expanded tail. We test these functional claims with skeletal and 
      flesh models of S. aegyptiacus. We assembled a CT-based skeletal reconstruction 
      based on the fossils, to which we added internal air and muscle to create a 
      posable flesh model. That model shows that on land S. aegyptiacus was bipedal and 
      in deep water was an unstable, slow-surface swimmer (<1 m/s) too buoyant to dive. 
      Living reptiles with similar spine-supported sails over trunk and tail are used 
      for display rather than aquatic propulsion, and nearly all extant secondary 
      swimmers have reduced limbs and fleshy tail flukes. New fossils also show that 
      Spinosaurus ranged far inland. Two stages are clarified in the evolution of 
      Spinosaurus, which is best understood as a semiaquatic bipedal ambush piscivore 
      that frequented the margins of coastal and inland waterways.

AB  - Recently, a set of publications described flea fossils from Jurassic and Early 
      Cretaceous geological strata in northeastern China, which were suggested to have 
      parasitized feathered dinosaurs, pterosaurs, and early birds or mammals. In 
      support of these fossils being fleas, a recent publication in BMC Evolutionary 
      Biology described the extended abdomen of a female fossil specimen as due to 
      blood feeding.We here comment on these findings, and conclude that the current 
      interpretation of the evolutionary trajectory and ecology of these putative 
      dinosaur fleas is based on appeal to probability, rather than evidence. Hence, 
      their taxonomic positioning as fleas, or stem fleas, as well as their ecological 
      classification as ectoparasites and blood feeders is not supported by currently 
      available data.

TI  - Biology of the sauropod dinosaurs: the evolution of gigantism.
PG  - 117-55
LID - 10.1111/j.1469-185X.2010.00137.x [doi]
AB  - The herbivorous sauropod dinosaurs of the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods were 
      the largest terrestrial animals ever, surpassing the largest herbivorous mammals 
      by an order of magnitude in body mass. Several evolutionary lineages among 
      Sauropoda produced giants with body masses in excess of 50 metric tonnes by 
      conservative estimates. With body mass increase driven by the selective 
      advantages of large body size, animal lineages will increase in body size until 
      they reach the limit determined by the interplay of bauplan, biology, and 
      resource availability. There is no evidence, however, that resource availability 
      and global physicochemical parameters were different enough in the Mesozoic to 
      have led to sauropod gigantism. We review the biology of sauropod dinosaurs in 
      detail and posit that sauropod gigantism was made possible by a specific 
      combination of plesiomorphic characters (phylogenetic heritage) and evolutionary 
      innovations at different levels which triggered a remarkable evolutionary 
      cascade. Of these key innovations, the most important probably was the very long 
      neck, the most conspicuous feature of the sauropod bauplan. Compared to other 
      herbivores, the long neck allowed more efficient food uptake than in other large 
      herbivores by covering a much larger feeding envelope and making food accessible 
      that was out of the reach of other herbivores. Sauropods thus must have been able 
      to take up more energy from their environment than other herbivores. The long 
      neck, in turn, could only evolve because of the small head and the extensive 
      pneumatization of the sauropod axial skeleton, lightening the neck. The small 
      head was possible because food was ingested without mastication. Both mastication 
      and a gastric mill would have limited food uptake rate. Scaling relationships 
      between gastrointestinal tract size and basal metabolic rate (BMR) suggest that 
      sauropods compensated for the lack of particle reduction with long retention 
      times, even at high uptake rates. The extensive pneumatization of the axial 
      skeleton resulted from the evolution of an avian-style respiratory system, 
      presumably at the base of Saurischia. An avian-style respiratory system would 
      also have lowered the cost of breathing, reduced specific gravity, and may have 
      been important in removing excess body heat. Another crucial innovation inherited 
      from basal dinosaurs was a high BMR. This is required for fueling the high growth 
      rate necessary for a multi-tonne animal to survive to reproductive maturity. The 
      retention of the plesiomorphic oviparous mode of reproduction appears to have 
      been critical as well, allowing much faster population recovery than in 
      megaherbivore mammals. Sauropods produced numerous but small offspring each 
      season while land mammals show a negative correlation of reproductive output to 
      body size. This permitted lower population densities in sauropods than in 
      megaherbivore mammals but larger individuals. Our work on sauropod dinosaurs thus 
      informs us about evolutionary limits to body size in other groups of herbivorous 
      terrestrial tetrapods. Ectothermic reptiles are strongly limited by their low 
      BMR, remaining small. Mammals are limited by their extensive mastication and 
      their vivipary, while ornithsichian dinosaurs were only limited by their 
      extensive mastication, having greater average body sizes than mammals.

AB  - The Frankfurt specimen of the early-branching ceratopsian dinosaur Psittacosaurus 
      is remarkable for the exquisite preservation of squamous (scaly) skin and other 
      soft tissues that cover almost its entire body. New observations under 
      Laser-Stimulated Fluorescence (LSF) reveal the complexity of the squamous skin of 
      Psittacosaurus, including several unique features and details of newly detected 
      and previously-described integumentary structures. Variations in the scaly skin 
      are found to be strongly regionalized in Psittacosaurus. For example, feature 
      scales consist of truncated cone-shaped scales on the shoulder, but form a 
      longitudinal row of quadrangular scales on the tail. Re-examined through LSF, the 
      cloaca of Psittacosaurus has a longitudinal opening, or vent; a condition that it 
      shares only with crocodylians. This implies that the cloaca may have had 
      crocodylian-like internal anatomy, including a single, ventrally-positioned 
      copulatory organ. Combined with these new integumentary data, a comprehensive 
      review of integument in ceratopsian dinosaurs reveals that scalation was 
      generally conservative in ceratopsians and typically consisted of large 
      subcircular-to-polygonal feature scales surrounded by a network of smaller 
      non-overlapping polygonal basement scales. This study highlights the importance 
      of combining exceptional specimens with modern imaging techniques, which are 
      helping to redefine the perceived complexity of squamation in ceratopsians and 
      other dinosaurs.

AB  - Dinosaurs and mammals have coexisted for the last ~ 230 million years. Both 
      groups arose during the Late Triassic and diversified throughout the Mesozoic and 
      into the Cenozoic (the latter in the form of birds). Although they undoubtedly 
      interacted in many ways, direct fossil evidence for their interaction is rare. 
      Here we report a new fossil find from the Lujiatun Member of the Lower Cretaceous 
      Yixian Formation of China, showing a gobiconodontid mammal and psittacosaurid 
      dinosaur locked in mortal combat. We entertain various hypothesized explanations 
      for this association, but the balance of the evidence suggests that it represents 
      a predation attempt on the part of the smaller mammal, suddenly interrupted by, 
      and preserved within, a lahar-type volcanic debris flow. Mesozoic mammals are 
      usually depicted as having lived in the shadows of their larger dinosaurian 
      contemporaries, but this new fossil convincingly demonstrates that mammals could 
      pose a threat even to near fully-grown dinosaurs. The Yixian Formation-and the 
      Chinese fossil Jehol Biota more broadly-have played a particularly important role 
      in revealing the diversity of small-bodied dinosaurs and other fauna. We 
      anticipate that the volcanically derived obrution deposits specific to the 
      Lujiatun Member will likewise continue to yield evidence for biotic interactions 
      otherwise unknown from the rest of the fossil record.

AB  - The Triassic (252-201 Ma) marks a major punctuation in Earth history, when 
      ecosystems rebuilt themselves following the devastating Permian-Triassic mass 
      extinction. Herbivory evolved independently several times as ecosystems 
      comprising diverse assemblages of therapsids, parareptiles and archosauromorphs 
      rose and fell, leading to a world dominated by dinosaurs. It was assumed that 
      dinosaurs prevailed either through long-term competitive replacement of the 
      incumbent clades or rapidly and opportunistically following one or more 
      extinction events. Here we use functional morphology and ecology to explore 
      herbivore morphospace through the Triassic and Early Jurassic. We identify five 
      main herbivore guilds (ingestion generalists, prehension specialists, durophagous 
      specialists, shearing pulpers, and heavy oral processors), and find that 
      herbivore clades generally avoided competition by almost exclusively occupying 
      different guilds. Major ecosystem remodelling was triggered multiple times by 
      external environmental challenges, and previously dominant herbivores were 
      marginalised by newly emerging forms. Dinosaur dominance was a mix of opportunity 
      following disaster, combined with competitive advantage in their new world.

TI  - Pterosaur melanosomes support signalling functions for early feathers.
PG  - 684-688
LID - 10.1038/s41586-022-04622-3 [doi]
AB  - Remarkably well-preserved soft tissues in Mesozoic fossils have yielded 
      substantial insights into the evolution of feathers(1). New evidence of branched 
      feathers in pterosaurs suggests that feathers originated in the avemetatarsalian 
      ancestor of pterosaurs and dinosaurs in the Early Triassic(2), but the homology 
      of these pterosaur structures with feathers is controversial(3,4). Reports of 
      pterosaur feathers with homogeneous ovoid melanosome geometries(2,5) suggest that 
      they exhibited limited variation in colour, supporting hypotheses that early 
      feathers functioned primarily in thermoregulation(6). Here we report the presence 
      of diverse melanosome geometries in the skin and simple and branched feathers of 
      a tapejarid pterosaur from the Early Cretaceous found in Brazil. The melanosomes 
      form distinct populations in different feather types and the skin, a feature 
      previously known only in theropod dinosaurs, including birds. These 
      tissue-specific melanosome geometries in pterosaurs indicate that manipulation of 
      feather colour-and thus functions of feathers in visual communication-has deep 
      evolutionary origins. These features show that genetic regulation of melanosome 
      chemistry and shape(7-9) was active early in feather evolution.

AB  - Whether or not nonavian dinosaur biodiversity declined prior to the 
      end-Cretaceous mass extinction remains controversial as the result of sampling 
      biases in the fossil record, differences in the analytical approaches used, and 
      the rarity of high-precision geochronological dating of dinosaur fossils. Using 
      magnetostratigraphy, cyclostratigraphy, and biostratigraphy, we establish a 
      high-resolution geochronological framework for the fossil-rich Late Cretaceous 
      sedimentary sequence in the Shanyang Basin of central China. We have found only 
      three dinosaurian eggshell taxa (Macroolithus yaotunensis, Elongatoolithus 
      elongatus, and Stromatoolithus pinglingensis) representing two clades 
      (Oviraptoridae and Hadrosauridae) in sediments deposited between ∼68.2 and ∼66.4 
      million y ago, indicating sustained low dinosaur biodiversity, and that 
      assessment is consistent with the known skeletal remains in the Shanyang and 
      surrounding basins of central China. Along with the dinosaur eggshell records 
      from eastern and southern China, we find a decline in dinosaur biodiversity from 
      the Campanian to the Maastrichtian. Our results support a long-term decline in 
      global dinosaur biodiversity prior to 66 million y ago, which likely set the 
      stage for the end-Cretaceous nonavian dinosaur mass extinction.

TI  - Femoral specializations to locomotor habits in early archosauriforms.
PG  - 867-892
LID - 10.1111/joa.13598 [doi]
AB  - The evolutionary history of archosaurs and their closest relatives is 
      characterized by a wide diversity of locomotor modes, which has even been 
      suggested as a pivotal aspect underlying the evolutionary success of dinosaurs 
      vs. pseudosuchians across the Triassic-Jurassic transition. This locomotor 
      diversity (e.g., more sprawling/erect; crouched/upright; quadrupedal/bipedal) led 
      to several morphofunctional specializations of archosauriform limb bones that 
      have been studied qualitatively as well as quantitatively through various linear 
      morphometric studies. However, differences in locomotor habits have never been 
      studied across the Triassic-Jurassic transition using 3D geometric morphometrics, 
      which can relate how morphological features vary according to biological factors 
      such as locomotor habit and body mass. Herein, we investigate morphological 
      variation across a dataset of 72 femora from 36 different species of 
      archosauriforms. First, we identify femoral head rotation, distal slope of the 
      fourth trochanter, femoral curvature, and the angle between the lateral condyle 
      and crista tibiofibularis as the main features varying between bipedal and 
      quadrupedal taxa, all of these traits having a stronger locomotor signal than the 
      lesser trochanter's proximal extent. We show a significant association between 
      locomotor mode and phylogeny, but with the locomotor signal being stronger than 
      the phylogenetic signal. This enables us to predict locomotor modes of some of 
      the more ambiguous early archosauriforms without relying on the relationships 
      between hindlimb and forelimb linear bone dimensions as in prior studies. Second, 
      we highlight that the most important morphological variation is linked to the 
      increase of body size, which impacts the width of the epiphyses and the roundness 
      and proximodistal position of the fourth trochanter. Furthermore, we show that 
      bipedal and quadrupedal archosauriforms have different allometric trajectories 
      along the morphological variation in relation to body size. Finally, we 
      demonstrate a covariation between locomotor mode and body size, with variations 
      in femoral bowing (anteroposterior curvature) being more distinct among robust 
      femora than gracile ones. We also identify a decoupling in fourth trochanter 
      variation between locomotor mode (symmetrical to semi-pendant) and body size 
      (sharp to rounded). Our results indicate a similar level of morphological 
      disparity linked to a clear convergence in femoral robusticity between the two 
      clades of archosauriforms (Pseudosuchia and Avemetatarsalia), emphasizing the 
      importance of accounting for body size when studying their evolutionary history, 
      as well as when studying the functional morphology of appendicular features. 
      Determining how early archosauriform skeletal features were impacted by locomotor 
      habits and body size also enables us to discuss the potential homoplasy of some 
      phylogenetic characters used previously in cladistic analyses as well as when 
      bipedalism evolved in the avemetatarsalian lineage. This study illuminates how 
      the evolution of femoral morphology in early archosauriforms was functionally 
      constrained by locomotor habit and body size, which should aid ongoing 
      discussions about the early evolution of dinosaurs and the nature of their 
      evolutionary "success" over pseudosuchians.

TI  - Decelerated dinosaur skull evolution with the origin of birds.
PG  - e3000801
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.3000801 [doi]
LID - e3000801
AB  - The evolutionary radiation of birds has produced incredible morphological 
      variation, including a huge range of skull form and function. Investigating how 
      this variation arose with respect to non-avian dinosaurs is key to understanding 
      how birds achieved their remarkable success after the Cretaceous-Paleogene 
      extinction event. Using a high-dimensional geometric morphometric approach, we 
      quantified the shape of the skull in unprecedented detail across 354 extant and 
      37 extinct avian and non-avian dinosaurs. Comparative analyses reveal fundamental 
      differences in how skull shape evolved in birds and non-avian dinosaurs. We find 
      that the overall skull shape evolved faster in non-avian dinosaurs than in birds 
      across all regions of the cranium. In birds, the anterior rostrum is the most 
      rapidly evolving skull region, whereas more posterior regions-such as the 
      parietal, squamosal, and quadrate-exhibited high rates in non-avian dinosaurs. 
      These fast-evolving elements in dinosaurs are strongly associated with feeding 
      biomechanics, forming the jaw joint and supporting the jaw adductor muscles. 
      Rapid pulses of skull evolution coincide with changes to food acquisition 
      strategies and diets, as well as the proliferation of bony skull ornaments. In 
      contrast to the appendicular skeleton, which has been shown to evolve more 
      rapidly in birds, avian cranial morphology is characterised by a striking 
      deceleration in morphological evolution relative to non-avian dinosaurs. These 
      results may be due to the reorganisation of skull structure in birds-including 
      loss of a separate postorbital bone in adults and the emergence of new trade-offs 
      with development and neurosensory demands. Taken together, the remarkable cranial 
      shape diversity in birds was not a product of accelerated evolution from their 
      non-avian relatives, despite their frequent portrayal as an icon of adaptive 
      radiations.

TI  - A new early branching armored dinosaur from the Lower Jurassic of southwestern 
      China.
LID - 10.7554/eLife.75248 [doi]
LID - e75248
AB  - The early evolutionary history of the armored dinosaurs (Thyreophora) is obscured 
      by their patchily distributed fossil record and by conflicting views on the 
      relationships of Early Jurassic taxa. Here, we describe an early diverging 
      thyreophoran from the Lower Jurassic Fengjiahe Formation of Yunnan Province, 
      China, on the basis of an associated partial skeleton that includes skull, axial, 
      limb, and armor elements. It can be diagnosed as a new taxon based on numerous 
      cranial and postcranial autapomorphies and is further distinguished from all 
      other thyreophorans by a unique combination of character states. Although the 
      robust postcranium is similar to that of more deeply nested ankylosaurs and 
      stegosaurs, phylogenetic analysis recovers it as either the sister taxon of 
      Emausaurus or of the clade Scelidosaurus+ Eurypoda. This new taxon, Yuxisaurus 
      kopchicki, represents the first valid thyreophoran dinosaur to be described from 
      the Early Jurassic of Asia and confirms the rapid geographic spread and 
      diversification of the clade after its first appearance in the Hettangian. Its 
      heavy build and distinctive armor also hint at previously unrealized 
      morphological diversity early in the clade's history.

OAB - From the plated Stegosaurus to the tank-like Ankylosaurus, armoured dinosaurs are 
      some of the most extraordinary creatures to have roamed the earth. Fossils from 
      this group are abundant from the Late Jurassic period, 155 million years ago, up 
      until the end of the age of the dinosaurs. However, only a few fossils exist from 
      the early part of the Jurassic, making it difficult to understand how these 
      fantastic beasts came to be. More early fossils could help to fill in gaps about 
      armoured dinosaur biology and evolution. Yao et al. describe the anatomy of a new 
      armoured dinosaur, baptized Yuxisaurus, which was found in rocks of Early 
      Jurassic age in southwestern China. Covered in sharp spines, this medium-sized 
      animal was much sturdier and stockier than its immediate relatives, suggesting 
      that the ancestors of Stegosaurus and Ankylosaurus had a wider variety of body 
      forms than once thought. Its presence in China also shows that armoured dinosaurs 
      spread across the world early in their history. Yuxisaurus could help researchers 
      to understand how million years of evolution produced the armoured species we are 
      more familiar with today. As more fossils may emerge from the rocks of 
      southwestern China, it could become possible to further piece together early 
      dinosaur evolution.

AB  - The Karoo igneous rocks represent one of the largest continental flood basalt 
      events (by volume) on Earth, and are not normally associated with fossils 
      remains. However, these Pliensbachian-Toarcian lava flows contain sandstone 
      interbeds that are particularly common in the lower part of the volcanic 
      succession and are occasionally fossiliferous. On a sandstone interbed in the 
      northern main Karoo Basin, we discovered twenty-five tridactyl and tetradactyl 
      vertebrate tracks comprising five trackways. The tracks are preserved among 
      desiccation cracks and low-amplitude, asymmetrical ripple marks, implying 
      deposition in low energy, shallow, ephemeral water currents. Based on footprint 
      lengths of 2-14 cm and trackway patterns, the trackmakers were both bipedal and 
      quadrupedal animals of assorted sizes with walking and running gaits. We describe 
      the larger tridactyl tracks as "grallatorid" and attribute them to bipedal 
      theropod dinosaurs, like Coelophysis, a genus common in the Early Jurassic of 
      southern Africa. The smallest tracks are tentatively interpreted as 
      Brasilichnium-like tracks, which are linked to synapsid trackmakers, a common 
      attribution of similar tracks from the Lower to Middle Jurassic record of 
      southern and southwestern Gondwana. The trackway of an intermediate-sized 
      quadruped reveals strong similarities in morphometric parameters to a post-Karoo 
      Zimbabwean trackway from Chewore. These trackways are classified here as a new 
      ichnogenus attributable to small ornithischian dinosaurs as yet without a body 
      fossil record in southern Africa. These tracks not only suggest that dinosaurs 
      and therapsids survived the onset of the Drakensberg volcanism, but also that 
      theropods, ornithischians and synapsids were among the last vertebrates that 
      inhabited the main Karoo Basin some 183 Ma ago. Although these vertebrates 
      survived the first Karoo volcanic eruptions, their rapidly dwindling habitat was 
      turned into a land of fire as it was covered by the outpouring lavas during one 
      of the most dramatic geological episodes in southern Africa.

AB  - For most fossil taxa, dietary inference relies primarily on indirect evidence 
      from jaw morphology and the dentition. In rare cases, however, preserved gut 
      contents provide direct evidence of feeding strategy and species interaction. 
      This is important in the reconstruction of food webs and energy flow through 
      ancient ecosystems. The Early Cretaceous Chinese Jehol Biota has yielded several 
      such examples, with lizards, birds, small dinosaurs, and mammals as both predator 
      and prey. Here we describe an Early Cretaceous fossil frog specimen, genus 
      Genibatrachus, that contains an adult salamander within its body cavity. The 
      salamander is attributed to the hynobiid-like genus Nuominerpeton. The salamander 
      skeleton is complete and articulated, suggesting it was caught and swallowed 
      shortly before the frog itself died and was buried.

AB  - Sauropod dinosaurs are a group of herbivorous dinosaurs which exceeded all other 
      terrestrial vertebrates in mean and maximal body size. Sauropod dinosaurs were 
      also the most successful and long-lived herbivorous tetrapod clade, but no 
      abiological factors such as global environmental parameters conducive to their 
      gigantism can be identified. These facts justify major efforts by evolutionary 
      biologists and paleontologists to understand sauropods as living animals and to 
      explain their evolutionary success and uniquely gigantic body size. Contributions 
      to this research program have come from many fields and can be synthesized into a 
      biological evolutionary cascade model of sauropod dinosaur gigantism (sauropod 
      gigantism ECM). This review focuses on the sauropod gigantism ECM, providing an 
      updated version based on the contributions to the PLoS ONE sauropod gigantism 
      collection and on other very recent published evidence. The model consist of five 
      separate evolutionary cascades ("Reproduction", "Feeding", "Head and neck", 
      "Avian-style lung", and "Metabolism"). Each cascade starts with observed or 
      inferred basal traits that either may be plesiomorphic or derived at the level of 
      Sauropoda. Each trait confers hypothetical selective advantages which permit the 
      evolution of the next trait. Feedback loops in the ECM consist of selective 
      advantages originating from traits higher in the cascades but affecting lower 
      traits. All cascades end in the trait "Very high body mass". Each cascade is 
      linked to at least one other cascade. Important plesiomorphic traits of sauropod 
      dinosaurs that entered the model were ovipary as well as no mastication of food. 
      Important evolutionary innovations (derived traits) were an avian-style 
      respiratory system and an elevated basal metabolic rate. Comparison with other 
      tetrapod lineages identifies factors limiting body size.

AB  - Feathers are a primitive trait among pennaraptoran dinosaurs, which today are 
      represented by crown birds (Neornithes), the only clade of dinosaurs to survive 
      the end Cretaceous mass extinction. Feathers are central to many important 
      functions and therefore, maintaining plumage function is of great importance for 
      survival. Thus, molt - by which new feathers are formed to replace old ones, is 
      an essential process. Our limited knowledge regarding molt in early pennaraptoran 
      evolution is based largely on a single Microraptor specimen. A survey of 92 
      feathered non-avian dinosaur and stem bird fossils did not find additional 
      molting evidence. Due to its longer duration, in ornithological collections 
      evidence of molt is found more frequently in extant bird species with sequential 
      molts compared to those with more rapid simultaneous molts. The low frequency of 
      molt occurrence among fossil specimens resembles collections of bird species with 
      simultaneous molts. The dearth of molt evidence in the forelimbs of pennaraptoran 
      specimens may have interesting implications regarding molt strategy during early 
      avian evolution, and suggests that the yearly molting cycle may have evolved 
      later, among crown birds.

AB  - Terror birds (Aves, Phorusrhacidae) comprise the most outstanding group of South 
      American Cenozoic avifauna, and have been considered dominant predators. 
      Terrestrial habits were inferred using the reduction of their forelimbs and high 
      body mass. Phorusrhacids were considered functionally tridactyl with three 
      relatively short digits II-IV and a small, elevated digit I. The function of the 
      ungual phalanges of digit II have been debated, including the utility of the 
      ungual for retention or stabbing of prey. Incomplete or lack of preservation of 
      foot bones have hampered understanding of the evolution and diversification of 
      Phorusrhacidae. Here we show the first known and well-preserved footprints of 
      Phorusrhacidae with a didactyl posture, which are named Rionegrina pozosaladensis 
      igen. et isp. nov. These footprints yield unprecedented information on the 
      locomotor habits of the group. The finding implies that medium-sized, Late 
      Miocene (~ 8 Ma) phorusrhacids developed strong cursorial adaptations; achieved 
      through reduction of digit II, raised metatarso-phalangeal pad, main body support 
      in a large and thick digit III, and digit IV as outrigger. Raised and long claw 
      of digit II was probably used in pining of prey. Phorusrhacid footprints differ 
      from the Early Cretaceous didactyl footprints of deinonychosaurian dinosaur 
      affinity by its larger size and strong mesaxony.

AB  - Live birth has evolved many times independently in vertebrates, such as mammals 
      and diverse groups of lizards and snakes. However, live birth is unknown in the 
      major clade Archosauromorpha, a group that first evolved some 260 million years 
      ago and is represented today by birds and crocodilians. Here we report the 
      discovery of a pregnant long-necked marine reptile (Dinocephalosaurus) from the 
      Middle Triassic (∼245 million years ago) of southwest China showing live birth in 
      archosauromorphs. Our discovery pushes back evidence of reproductive biology in 
      the clade by roughly 50 million years, and shows that there is no fundamental 
      reason that archosauromorphs could not achieve live birth. Our phylogenetic 
      models indicate that Dinocephalosaurus determined the sex of their offspring by 
      sex chromosomes rather than by environmental temperature like crocodilians. Our 
      results provide crucial evidence for genotypic sex determination facilitating 
      land-water transitions in amniotes.

AB  - Reconstructing the evolution, diversity, and paleobiogeography of North America's 
      Late Cretaceous dinosaur assemblages require spatiotemporally contiguous data; 
      however, there remains a spatial and temporal disparity in dinosaur data on the 
      continent. The rarity of vertebrate-bearing sedimentary deposits representing 
      Turonian-Santonian ecosystems, and the relatively sparse record of dinosaurs from 
      the eastern portion of the continent, present persistent challenges for studies 
      of North American dinosaur evolution. Here we describe an assemblage of 
      ornithomimosaurian materials from the Santonian Eutaw Formation of Mississippi. 
      Morphological data coupled with osteohistological growth markers suggest the 
      presence of two taxa of different body sizes, including one of the largest 
      ornithomimosaurians known worldwide. The regression predicts a femoral 
      circumference and a body mass of the Eutaw individuals similar to or greater than 
      that of large-bodied ornithomimosaurs, Beishanlong grandis, and Gallimimus 
      bullatus. The paleoosteohistology of MMNS VP-6332 demonstrates that the 
      individual was at least ten years of age (similar to B. grandis [~375 kg, 13-14 
      years old at death]). Additional pedal elements share some intriguing features 
      with ornithomimosaurs, yet suggest a larger-body size closer to Deinocheirus 
      mirificus. The presence of a large-bodied ornithomimosaur in this region during 
      this time is consistent with the relatively recent discoveries of 
      early-diverging, large-bodied ornithomimosaurs from mid-Cretaceous strata of 
      Laurasia (Arkansaurus fridayi and B. grandis). The smaller Eutaw taxon is 
      represented by a tibia preserving seven growth cycles, with osteohistological 
      indicators of decreasing growth, yet belongs to an individual approaching somatic 
      maturity, suggesting the co-existence of medium- and large-bodied ornithomimosaur 
      taxa during the Late Cretaceous Santonian of North America. The Eutaw 
      ornithomimosaur materials provide key information on the diversity and 
      distribution of North American ornithomimosaurs and Appalachian dinosaurs and fit 
      with broader evidence of multiple cohabiting species of ornithomimosaurian 
      dinosaurs in Late Cretaceous ecosystems of Laurasia.

TI  - Oldest preserved umbilical scar reveals dinosaurs had 'belly buttons'.
PG  - 132

AB  - BACKGROUND: In egg-laying amniotes, the developing embryo is tethered to a number 
      of the extraembryonic membranes including the yolk sac and allantois that deliver 
      oxygen and nutrients and remove metabolic waste products throughout embryonic 
      development. Prior to, or soon after hatching, these membranes detach from the 
      animal leaving a temporary or permanent umbilical scar (umbilicus) equivalent to 
      the navel or 'belly button' in some placental mammals, including humans. Although 
      ubiquitous in modern mammals and reptiles (including birds), at least early in 
      their ontogeny, the umbilicus has not been identified in any pre-Cenozoic 
      amniote. RESULTS: We report the oldest preserved umbilicus in a fossil amniote 
      from a ~130-million-year-old early-branching ceratopsian dinosaur, 
      Psittacosaurus. Under laser-stimulated fluorescence (LSF), the umbilicus is 
      revealed as an elongate midline structure delimited by a row of paired scales on 
      the abdomen. The relatively late ontogenetic stage (close to sexual maturity) 
      estimated for the individual indicates that the umbilicus was probably retained 
      throughout life. CONCLUSIONS: Unlike most extant reptiles and birds that lose 
      this scar within days to weeks after hatching, the umbilicus of Psittacosaurus 
      persisted at least until sexual maturity, similar to some lizards and 
      crocodylians with which it shares the closest morphological resemblance. This 
      discovery is the oldest record of an amniote umbilicus and the first in a 
      non-avian dinosaur. However, given the variability of this structure in extant 
      reptilian analogues, a persistent umbilical scar may not have been present in all 
      non-avian dinosaurs.

AB  - The last half century of paleornithological research has transformed the way that 
      biologists perceive the evolutionary history of birds. This transformation has 
      been driven, since 1969, by a series of exciting fossil discoveries combined with 
      intense scientific debate over how best to interpret these discoveries. Ideally, 
      as evidence accrues and results accumulate, interpretive scientific agreement 
      forms. But this has not entirely happened in the debate over avian origins: the 
      accumulation of scientific evidence and analyses has had some effect, but not a 
      conclusive one, in terms of resolving the question of avian origins. Although the 
      majority of biologists have come to accept that birds are dinosaurs, there is 
      lingering and, in some quarters, strident opposition to this view. In order to 
      both understand the ongoing disagreement about avian origins and generate a 
      prediction about the future of the debate, here we use a revised model of 
      scientific practice to assess the current and historical state of play 
      surrounding the topic of bird evolutionary origins. Many scientists are familiar 
      with the metascientific scholars Sir Karl Popper and Thomas Kuhn, and these are 
      the primary figures that have been appealed to so far, in prior attempts to 
      assess the dispute. But we demonstrate that a variation of Imre Lakatos's model 
      of progressive versus degenerative research programmes provides a novel and 
      productive assessment of the debate. We establish that a refurbished Lakatosian 
      account both explains the intractability of the dispute and predicts a likely 
      outcome for the debate about avian origins. In short, here, we offer a 
      metascientific tool for rationally assessing competing theories-one that allows 
      researchers involved in seemingly intractable scientific disputes to advance 
      their debates.

AB  - The spectacular fossil fauna and flora preserved in the Upper Cretaceous 
      terrestrial strata of North America's Western Interior Basin record an 
      exceptional peak in the diversification of fossil vertebrates in the Campanian, 
      which has been termed the 'zenith of dinosaur diversity'. The wide latitudinal 
      distribution of rocks and fossils that represent this episode, spanning from 
      northern Mexico to the northern slopes of Alaska, provides a unique opportunity 
      to gain insights into dinosaur paleoecology and to address outstanding questions 
      regarding faunal provinciality in connection to paleogeography and climate. 
      Whereas reliable basin-wide correlations are fundamental to investigations of 
      this sort, three decades of radioisotope geochronology of various vintages and 
      limited compatibility has complicated correlation of distant fossil-bearing 
      successions and given rise to contradictory paleobiogeographic and evolutionary 
      hypotheses. Here we present new U-Pb geochronology by the CA-ID-TIMS method for 
      16 stratigraphically well constrained bentonite beds, ranging in age from 
      82.419 ± 0.074 Ma to 73.496 ± 0.039 Ma (2σ internal uncertainties), and the 
      resulting Bayesian age models for six key fossil-bearing formations over a 
      1600 km latitudinal distance from northwest New Mexico, USA to southern Alberta, 
      Canada. Our high-resolution chronostratigraphic framework for the upper Campanian 
      of the Western Interior Basin reveals that despite their contrasting depositional 
      settings and basin evolution histories, significant age overlap exists between 
      the main fossil-bearing intervals of the Kaiparowits Formation (southern Utah), 
      Judith River Formation (central Montana), Two Medicine Formation (western 
      Montana) and Dinosaur Park Formation (southern Alberta). Pending more extensive 
      paleontologic collecting that would allow more rigorous faunal analyses, our 
      results support a first-order connection between paleoecologic and fossil 
      diversities and help overcome the chronostratigraphic ambiguities that have 
      impeded the testing of proposed models of latitudinal provinciality of dinosaur 
      taxa during the Campanian.

AB  - Tooth replacement rate is an important contributor to feeding ecology for 
      polyphyodont animals. Dinosaurs exhibit a wide range of tooth replacement rates, 
      mirroring their diverse craniofacial specializations, but little is known about 
      broad-scale allometric or evolutionary patterns within the group. In the current 
      broad but sparse dinosaurian sample, only three non-avian theropod tooth 
      replacement rates have been estimated. We estimated tooth formation and 
      replacement rates in three additional non-avian theropod dinosaurs, the derived 
      latest Cretaceous abelisaurid Majungasaurus and the more generalized Late 
      Jurassic Allosaurus and Ceratosaurus. We created the largest dental histological 
      and CT dataset for any theropod dinosaur, sectioning and scanning over a dozen 
      toothed elements of Majungasaurus and several additional elements from the other 
      two genera. Using this large sample, we created models of tooth formation time 
      that allow for theropod replacement rates to be estimated non-destructively. In 
      contrast to previous results for theropods, we found high tooth replacement rates 
      in all three genera, with Allosaurus and Ceratosaurus rates of ~100 days and 56 
      days for Majungasaurus. The latter rate is on par with those of derived 
      herbivorous dinosaurs including some neosauropods, hadrosaurids, and 
      ceratopsians. This elevated rate may be a response to high rates of tooth wear in 
      Majungasaurus. Within Dinosauria, there is no relationship between body mass and 
      tooth replacement rate and no trends in replacement rate over time. Rather, tooth 
      replacement rate is clade-specific, with elevated rates in abelisaurids and 
      diplodocoids and lower rates in coelurosaurs.

AB  - One of the fossil record's most puzzling features is the absence of preserved 
      eggs or eggshell for the first third of the known 315 million year history of 
      amniote evolution. Our meagre understanding of the origin and evolution of 
      calcareous eggshell and amniotic eggs in general, is largely based on Middle 
      Jurassic to Late Cretaceous fossils. For dinosaurs, the most parsimonious 
      inference yields a thick, hard shelled egg, so richly represented in the Late 
      Cretaceous fossil record. Here, we show that a thin calcareous layer (≤100 µm) 
      with interlocking units of radiating crystals (mammillae) and a thick shell 
      membrane already characterize the oldest known amniote eggs, belonging to three 
      coeval, but widely distributed Early Jurassic basal sauropodomorph dinosaurs. 
      This thin shell layer strongly contrasts with the considerably thicker calcareous 
      shells of Late Jurassic dinosaurs. Phylogenetic analyses and their Sinemurian age 
      indicate that the thin eggshell of basal sauropodomorphs represents a major 
      evolutionary innovation at the base of Dinosauria and that the much thicker 
      eggshell of sauropods, theropods, and ornithischian dinosaurs evolved 
      independently. Advanced mineralization of amniote eggshell (≥150 µm in thickness) 
      in general occurred not earlier than Middle Jurassic and may correspond with a 
      global trend of increase in atmospheric oxygen.

AB  - Most carnivorous mammals can pulverize skeletal elements by generating tooth 
      pressures between occluding teeth that exceed cortical bone shear strength, 
      thereby permitting access to marrow and phosphatic salts. Conversely, carnivorous 
      reptiles have non-occluding dentitions that engender negligible bone damage 
      during feeding. As a result, most reptilian predators can only consume bones in 
      their entirety. Nevertheless, North American tyrannosaurids, including the giant 
      (13 metres [m]) theropod dinosaur Tyrannosaurus rex stand out for habitually 
      biting deeply into bones, pulverizing and digesting them. How this mammal-like 
      capacity was possible, absent dental occlusion, is unknown. Here we analyzed T. 
      rex feeding behaviour from trace evidence, estimated bite forces and tooth 
      pressures, and studied tooth-bone contacts to provide the answer. We show that 
      bone pulverization was made possible through a combination of: (1) prodigious 
      bite forces (8,526-34,522 newtons [N]) and tooth pressures (718-2,974 megapascals 
      [MPa]) promoting crack propagation in bones, (2) tooth form and dental arcade 
      configurations that concentrated shear stresses, and (3) repetitive, localized 
      biting. Collectively, these capacities and behaviors allowed T. rex to finely 
      fragment bones and more fully exploit large dinosaur carcasses for sustenance 
      relative to competing carnivores.

AB  - We report here the first dinosaur skeletal material described from the marine Fox 
      Hills Formation (Maastrichtian) of western South Dakota. The find consists of two 
      theropod pedal phalanges: one recovered from the middle part of the Fairpoint 
      Member in Meade County, South Dakota; and the other from the Iron Lightning 
      Member in Ziebach County, South Dakota. Comparison with pedal phalanges of other 
      theropods suggests strongly that the Fairpoint specimen is a right pedal phalanx, 
      possibly III-2, from a large ornithomimid. The Iron Lightning specimen we 
      cautiously identify as an ornithomimid left pedal phalanx II-2. The Fairpoint 
      bone comes from thinly bedded and cross-bedded marine sandstones containing large 
      hematitic concretions and concretionary horizons. Associated fossils include 
      osteichthyan teeth, fin spines and otoliths, and abundant teeth of common 
      Cretaceous nearshore and pelagic chondrichthyans. Leaf impressions and other 
      plant debris, blocks of fossilized wood, and Ophiomorpha burrows are also common. 
      The Iron Lightning bone comes from a channel deposit composed of fine to coarse 
      sandstone beds, some of which contain bivalves, and a disseminated assemblage of 
      mammal teeth, chondrichthyan teeth, and fragmentary dinosaur teeth and claws. We 
      interpret the depositional environment of the two specimens as marginal marine. 
      The Fairpoint bone derives from a nearshore foreset setting, above wave base 
      subject to tidal flux and storm activity. The Iron Lightning specimen comes from 
      a topset channel infill probably related to deposition on a tidal flat or 
      associated coastal setting. The taphonomic history and ages of the two bones 
      differ. Orthogonal cracks in the cortical bone of the Fairpoint specimen suggest 
      post-mortem desiccation in a dryland coastal setting prior to transport and 
      preservation in the nearby nearshore setting described above. The pristine 
      surface of the Iron Lightning specimen indicates little transport before 
      incorporation into the channel deposit in which it was found. The Fairpoint bone 
      bed most probably lies within the Hoploscaphites nicolletii Ammonite Zone of the 
      early late Maastrichtian, and would therefore have an approximate age of 69 Ma. 
      The Iron Lightning bone is from the overlying H. nebrascensis Ammonite Zone, and 
      is thus about one million years younger.

TI  - Nonplantigrade Foot Posture: A Constraint on Dinosaur Body Size.
PG  - e0145716
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0145716 [doi]
LID - e0145716
AB  - Dinosaurs had functionally digitigrade or sub-unguligrade foot postures. With 
      their immediate ancestors, dinosaurs were the only terrestrial nonplantigrades 
      during the Mesozoic. Extant terrestrial mammals have different optimal body sizes 
      according to their foot posture (plantigrade, digitigrade, and unguligrade), yet 
      the relationship of nonplantigrade foot posture with dinosaur body size has never 
      been investigated, even though the body size of dinosaurs has been studied 
      intensively. According to a large dataset presented in this study, the body sizes 
      of all nonplantigrades (including nonvolant dinosaurs, nonvolant terrestrial 
      birds, extant mammals, and extinct Nearctic mammals) are above 500 g, except for 
      macroscelid mammals (i.e., elephant shrew), a few alvarezsauroid dinosaurs, and 
      nondinosaur ornithodirans (i.e., the immediate ancestors of dinosaurs). When 
      nonplantigrade tetrapods evolved from plantigrade ancestors, lineages with 
      nonplantigrade foot posture exhibited a steady increase in body size following 
      Cope's rule. In contrast, contemporaneous plantigrade lineages exhibited no trend 
      in body size evolution and were largely constrained to small body sizes. This 
      evolutionary pattern of body size specific to foot posture occurred repeatedly 
      during both the Mesozoic and the Cenozoic eras. Although disturbed by the 
      end-Cretaceous extinction, species of mid to large body size have predominantly 
      been nonplantigrade animals from the Jurassic until the present; conversely, 
      species with small body size have been exclusively composed of plantigrades in 
      the nonvolant terrestrial tetrapod fauna.

AB  - Birds have a highly specialized and efficient digestive system, but when this 
      system originated remains uncertain. Here we report six gastric pellets 
      attributable to the recently discovered 160-million-year-old troodontid dinosaur 
      Anchiornis, which is among the key taxa for understanding the transition to 
      birds. The gastric pellets contain lightly acid-etched lizard bones or fish 
      scales, and some are associated with Anchiornis skeletons or even situated within 
      the oesophagus. Anchiornis is the earliest and most basal theropod known to have 
      produced gastric pellets. In combination with other lines of evidence, the 
      pellets suggest that a digestive system resembling that of modern birds was 
      already present in basal members of the Paraves, a clade including troodontids, 
      dromaeosaurids, and birds, and that the evolution of modern avian digestion may 
      have been related to the appearance of aerial locomotion in this lineage.

AB  - Previous findings on dinosaur cartilage material from the Late Cretaceous of 
      Montana suggested that cartilage is a vertebrate tissue with unique 
      characteristics that favor nuclear preservation. Here, we analyze additional 
      dinosaur cartilage in Caudipteryx (STM4-3) from the Early Cretaceous Jehol biota 
      of Northeast China. The cartilage fragment is highly diagenetically altered when 
      observed in ground-sections but shows exquisite preservation after 
      demineralization. It reveals transparent, alumino-silicified chondrocytes and 
      brown, ironized chondrocytes. The histochemical stain Hematoxylin and Eosin (that 
      stains the nucleus and cytoplasm in extant cells) was applied to both the 
      demineralized cartilage of Caudipteryx and that of a chicken. The two specimens 
      reacted identically, and one dinosaur chondrocyte revealed a nucleus with 
      fossilized threads of chromatin. This is the second example of fossilized 
      chromatin threads in a vertebrate material. These data show that some of the 
      original nuclear biochemistry is preserved in this dinosaur cartilage material 
      and further support the hypothesis that cartilage is very prone to nuclear 
      fossilization and a perfect candidate to further understand DNA preservation in 
      deep time.

TI  - Neurovascular anatomy of dwarf dinosaur implies precociality in sauropods.
LID - 10.7554/eLife.82190 [doi]
LID - e82190
AB  - Macronaria, a group of mostly colossal sauropod dinosaurs, comprised the largest 
      terrestrial vertebrates of Earth's history. However, some of the smallest 
      sauropods belong to this group as well. The Late Jurassic macronarian island 
      dwarf Europasaurus holgeri is one of the most peculiar and best-studied sauropods 
      worldwide. So far, the braincase material of this taxon from Germany pended 
      greater attention. With the aid of micro-computed tomography (microCT), we report 
      on the neuroanatomy of the nearly complete braincase of an adult individual, as 
      well as the inner ears (endosseous labyrinths) of one other adult and several 
      juveniles (the latter also containing novel vascular cavities). The presence of 
      large and morphologically adult inner ears in juvenile material suggests 
      precociality. Our findings add to the diversity of neurovascular anatomy in 
      sauropod braincases and buttress the perception of sauropods as fast-growing and 
      autonomous giants with manifold facets of reproductive and social behaviour. This 
      suggests that - apart from sheer size - little separated Europasaurus from its 
      large-bodied relatives.

OAB - Dinosaurs, like all animals with spines, had their main sensory organs – the 
      organs that allowed them to listen, taste, see, smell, think and even keep their 
      balance – on their heads. This means that studying their fossilized skulls can 
      provide a wealth of information about how these animals perceived their 
      environment through so-called ‘endocasts’ (digital models of the cavities within 
      the skull). Endocasts of the skulls of many different dinosaur species already 
      exist, but a small species called Europasaurus holgeri had so far not received 
      this treatment. This sauropod lived in what is now northern Germany during the 
      Late Jurassic period (154 million years ago), and it owed its reduced size to 
      having become isolated on an island, where it became smaller after many 
      generations. Schade et al. wanted to gain a better understanding of certain 
      lifestyle aspects of the biology of E. holgeri, and to be able to compare the 
      endocast anatomy of this species to other dinosaurs. To do this, the team studied 
      the braincases of both very young and mature E. holgeri individuals using a 
      technique called computer tomography. The approach taken by Schade et al. allowed 
      them to examine and describe in detail the inner cavities that once contained the 
      brain, inner ears, nerves and blood supply of eight different E. holgeri 
      individuals. They found that the inner ears of small and young E. holgeri 
      individuals were almost as large as those of their adult counterparts, and very 
      similar in shape. Given that inner ears have roles in both audition and the sense 
      of equilibrium, this suggests that E. holgeri babies were able to leave their 
      nest very soon after hatching. This makes it likely that the babies of the 
      species were highly developed when they hatched, and could probably feed 
      themselves almost immediately, possibly similar to chickens. Furthermore, the 
      relatively large size of the part of the inner ear responsible for hearing hints 
      at E. holgeri being well able to communicate with other members of the species 
      using sound. The findings of Schade et al. add to the diversity of the record on 
      the anatomy of the braincases of dinosaurs. Additionally, the results support the 
      idea that sauropods may have been herd-living animals with social interactions 
      that grew very fast and had to be light on their feet very early in life. 
      Finally, comparing the endocasts of E. holgeri to those of other dinosaurs 
      suggests that, beyond a discrepancy in body size, this species was very similar 
      to its larger relatives on the Jurassic mainland.

AB  - Beipiaosaurus inexpectus, from the Lower Cretaceous Yixian Formation (Sihetun 
      locality, near Beipiao), Liaoning, China, is a key taxon for understanding the 
      early evolution of therizinosaurians. Since initial publication in 1999, only the 
      cranial elements of this taxon have been described in detail. Here we present a 
      detailed description of the postcranial skeletal anatomy of the holotype specimen 
      of B. inexpectus, including two never before described dorsal vertebrae from the 
      anterior half of the series. Based on these observations, and comparisons with 
      the postcranial skeleton of therizinosaurian taxa named since the most recent 
      diagnosis, we revised the diagnostic features for B. inexpectus adding three new 
      possible autapomorphies (PII-3 shorter than PIII-4, subequal length of the pre- 
      and postacetabular portions of the ilium, and equidimensional pubic peduncle of 
      ilium). Additionally, we also propose three possible synapomorphies for more 
      inclusive taxa (Therizinosauroidea and Therizinosauridae) and discuss 
      implications for evolutionary trends within Therizinosauria. The newly acquired 
      data from the postcranial osteology of the holotype specimen of B. inexpectus 
      sheds light on our understanding of postcranial skeletal evolution and 
      identification of therizinosaurians.

AB  - Large plant-eating dinosaurs are usually presumed to have been strictly 
      herbivorous, because their derived teeth and jaws were capable of processing 
      fibrous plant foods. This inferred feeding behavior offers a generalized view of 
      dinosaur food habits, but rare direct fossil evidence of diet provides more 
      nuanced insights into feeding behavior. Here we describe fossilized feces 
      (coprolites) that demonstrate recurring consumption of crustaceans and rotted 
      wood by large Late Cretaceous dinosaurs. These multi-liter coprolites from the 
      Kaiparowits Formation are primarily composed of comminuted conifer wood tissues 
      that were fungally degraded before ingestion. Thick fragments of laminar 
      crustacean cuticle are scattered within the coprolite contents and suggest that 
      the dinosaurian defecators consumed sizeable crustaceans that sheltered in 
      rotting logs. The diet of decayed wood and crustaceans offered a substantial 
      supply of plant polysaccharides, with added dividends of animal protein and 
      calcium. Nevertheless, it is unlikely that the fossilized fecal residues depict 
      year-round feeding habits. It is more reasonable to infer that these coprolites 
      reflected seasonal dietary shifts-possibly related to the dinosaurs' oviparous 
      breeding activities. This surprising fossil evidence challenges conventional 
      notions of herbivorous dinosaur diets and reveals a degree of dietary flexibility 
      that is consistent with that of extant herbivorous birds.

AB  - The question why non-avian dinosaurs went extinct 66 million years ago (Ma) 
      remains unresolved because of the coarseness of the fossil record. A sudden 
      extinction caused by an asteroid is the most accepted hypothesis but it is 
      debated whether dinosaurs were in decline or not before the impact. We analyse 
      the speciation-extinction dynamics for six key dinosaur families, and find a 
      decline across dinosaurs, where diversification shifted to a declining-diversity 
      pattern ~76 Ma. We investigate the influence of ecological and physical factors, 
      and find that the decline of dinosaurs was likely driven by global climate 
      cooling and herbivorous diversity drop. The latter is likely due to hadrosaurs 
      outcompeting other herbivores. We also estimate that extinction risk is related 
      to species age during the decline, suggesting a lack of evolutionary novelty or 
      adaptation to changing environments. These results support an environmentally 
      driven decline of non-avian dinosaurs well before the asteroid impact.

AB  - Sauropod dinosaurs are well known for their massive sizes and long necks and 
      tails. Among sauropods, flagellicaudatan dinosaurs are characterized by extreme 
      tail elongation, which has led to hypotheses regarding tail function, often 
      compared to a whip. Here, we analyse the dynamics of motion of a 3D model of an 
      apatosaurine flagellicaudatan tail using multibody simulation and quantify the 
      stress-bearing capabilities of the associated soft tissues. Such an elongated and 
      slender structure would allow achieving tip velocities in the order of 30 m/s, or 
      100 km/h, far slower than the speed of sound, due to the combined effect of 
      friction of the musculature and articulations, as well as aerodynamic drag. The 
      material properties of the skin, tendons, and ligaments also support such 
      evidence, proving that in life, the tail would not have withstood the stresses 
      imposed by travelling at the speed of sound, irrespective of the conjectural 
      'popper', a hypothetical soft tissue structure analogue to the terminal portion 
      of a bullwhip able to surpass the speed of sound.

TI  - The endocranium and trophic ecology of Velociraptor mongoliensis.
PG  - 861-869
LID - 10.1111/joa.13253 [doi]
AB  - Neuroanatomical reconstructions of extinct animals have long been recognized as 
      powerful proxies for palaeoecology, yet our understanding of the endocranial 
      anatomy of dromaeosaur theropod dinosaurs is still incomplete. Here, we used 
      X-ray computed microtomography (µCT) to reconstruct and describe the endocranial 
      anatomy, including the endosseous labyrinth of the inner ear, of the small-bodied 
      dromaeosaur, Velociraptor mongoliensis. The anatomy of the cranial endocast and 
      ear were compared with non-avian theropods, modern birds, and other extant 
      archosaurs to establish trends in agility, balance, and hearing thresholds in 
      order to reconstruct the trophic ecology of the taxon. Our results indicate that 
      V. mongoliensis could detect a wide and high range of sound frequencies 
      (2,368-3,965 Hz), was agile, and could likely track prey items with ease. When 
      viewed in conjunction with fossils that suggest scavenging-like behaviours in 
      V. mongoliensis, a complex trophic ecology that mirrors modern predators becomes 
      apparent. These data suggest that V. mongoliensis was an active predator that 
      would likely scavenge depending on the age and health of the individual or during 
      prolonged climatic events such as droughts.

AB  - Ornithischian dinosaurs exhibited a diversity of ecologies, locomotory modes, and 
      social structures, making them an ideal clade in which to study the evolution of 
      neuroanatomy and behaviour. Here, we present a 3D digital reconstruction of the 
      endocranial spaces of the latest Cretaceous neornithischian Thescelosaurus 
      neglectus, in order to interpret the neuroanatomy and paleobiology of one of the 
      last surviving non-avian dinosaurs. Results demonstrate that the brain of 
      Thescelosaurus was relatively small compared to most other neornithischians, 
      instead suggesting cognitive capabilities within the range of extant reptiles. 
      Other traits include a narrow hearing range, with limited ability to distinguish 
      high frequencies, paired with unusually well-developed olfactory lobes and 
      anterior semicircular canals, indicating acute olfaction and vestibular 
      sensitivity. This character combination, in conjunction with features of the 
      postcranial anatomy, is consistent with specializations for burrowing behaviours 
      in the clade, as evidenced by trace and skeletal fossil evidence in 
      earlier-diverging thescelosaurids, although whether they reflect ecological 
      adaptations or phylogenetic inheritance in T. neglectus itself is unclear. 
      Nonetheless, our results provide the first evidence of neurological 
      specializations to burrowing identified within Ornithischia, and non-avian 
      dinosaurs more generally, expanding the range of ecological adaptations 
      recognized within this major clade.

AB  - Sauropods are familiar dinosaurs, immediately recognisable by their great size 
      and long necks. However, their necks are much less well known than is often 
      assumed. Surprisingly few complete necks have been described in the literature, 
      and even important specimens such as the Carnegie Diplodocus and Apatosaurus, and 
      the giant Berlin brachiosaur, in fact have imperfectly known necks. In older 
      specimens, missing bone is often difficult to spot due to over-enthusiastic 
      restoration. Worse still, even those vertebrae that are complete are often badly 
      distorted-for example, in consecutive cervicals of the Carnegie Diplodocus CM 84, 
      the aspect ratio of the posterior articular facet of the centrum varies so 
      dramatically that C14 appears 35% broader proportionally than C13. And even in 
      specimens where the cervicodorsal sequence is preserved, it is often difficult or 
      impossible to confidently identify which vertebra is the first dorsal. Widespread 
      incompleteness and distortion are both inevitable due to sauropod anatomy: large 
      size made it almost impossible for whole individuals to be preserved because 
      sediment cannot be deposited quickly enough to cover a giant carcass on land; and 
      distortion of presacral vertebrae is common due to their lightweight hollow 
      construction. This ubiquitous incompleteness and unpredictable distortion 
      compromise attempts to mechanically analyze necks, for example to determine 
      habitual neck posture and range of motion by modelling articulations between 
      vertebrae.

AB  - Ticks are currently among the most prevalent blood-feeding ectoparasites, but 
      their feeding habits and hosts in deep time have long remained speculative. Here, 
      we report direct and indirect evidence in 99 million-year-old Cretaceous amber 
      showing that hard ticks and ticks of the extinct new family Deinocrotonidae fed 
      on blood from feathered dinosaurs, non-avialan or avialan excluding crown-group 
      birds. A †Cornupalpatum burmanicum hard tick is entangled in a pennaceous 
      feather. Two deinocrotonids described as †Deinocroton draculi gen. et sp. nov. 
      have specialised setae from dermestid beetle larvae (hastisetae) attached to 
      their bodies, likely indicating cohabitation in a feathered dinosaur nest. A 
      third conspecific specimen is blood-engorged, its anatomical features suggesting 
      that deinocrotonids fed rapidly to engorgement and had multiple gonotrophic 
      cycles. These findings provide insight into early tick evolution and ecology, and 
      shed light on poorly known arthropod-vertebrate interactions and potential 
      disease transmission during the Mesozoic.

TI  - Shrinking dinosaurs and the evolution of endothermy in birds.
PG  - eaaw4486
LID - 10.1126/sciadv.aaw4486 [doi]
LID - eaaw4486
AB  - The evolution of endothermy represents a major transition in vertebrate history, 
      yet how and why endothermy evolved in birds and mammals remains controversial. 
      Here, we combine a heat transfer model with theropod body size data to 
      reconstruct the evolution of metabolic rates along the bird stem lineage. Results 
      suggest that a reduction in size constitutes the path of least resistance for 
      endothermy to evolve, maximizing thermal niche expansion while obviating the 
      costs of elevated energy requirements. In this scenario, metabolism would have 
      increased with the miniaturization observed in the Early-Middle Jurassic (~180 to 
      170 million years ago), resulting in a gradient of metabolic levels in the 
      theropod phylogeny. Whereas basal theropods would exhibit lower metabolic rates, 
      more recent nonavian lineages were likely decent thermoregulators with elevated 
      metabolism. These analyses provide a tentative temporal sequence of the key 
      evolutionary transitions that resulted in the emergence of small, endothermic, 
      feathered flying dinosaurs.

TI  - Why did the dinosaurs become extinct? Could cholecalciferol (vitamin D(3)) 
      deficiency be the answer?

LID - e9
AB  - Palaeontological deductions from the fossil remnants of extinct dinosaurs tell us 
      much about their classification into species as well as about their physiological 
      and behavioural characteristics. Geological evidence indicates that dinosaurs 
      became extinct at the boundary between the Cretaceous and Paleogene eras, about 
      66 million years ago, at a time when there was worldwide environmental change 
      resulting from the impact of a large celestial object with the Earth and/or from 
      vast volcanic eruptions. However, apart from the presumption that climate change 
      and interference with food supply contributed to their extinction, no biological 
      mechanism has been suggested to explain why such a diverse range of terrestrial 
      vertebrates ceased to exist. One of perhaps several contributing mechanisms comes 
      by extrapolating from the physiology of the avian descendants of dinosaurs. This 
      raises the possibility that cholecalciferol (vitamin D(3)) deficiency of 
      developing embryos in dinosaur eggs could have caused their death before 
      hatching, thus extinguishing the entire family of dinosaurs through failure to 
      reproduce.

AB  - Dinosauria debuted on Earth's stage in the aftermath of the Permo-Triassic Mass 
      Extinction Event, and survived two other Triassic extinction intervals to 
      eventually dominate terrestrial ecosystems. More than 231 million years ago, in 
      the Upper Triassic Ischigualasto Formation of west-central Argentina, dinosaurs 
      were just getting warmed up. At this time, dinosaurs represented a minor fraction 
      of ecosystem diversity. Members of other tetrapod clades, including synapsids and 
      pseudosuchians, shared convergently evolved features related to locomotion, 
      feeding, respiration, and metabolism and could have risen to later dominance. 
      However, it was Dinosauria that radiated in the later Mesozoic most significantly 
      in terms of body size, diversity, and global distribution. Elevated growth rates 
      are one of the adaptations that set later Mesozoic dinosaurs apart, particularly 
      from their contemporary crocodilian and mammalian compatriots. When did the 
      elevated growth rates of dinosaurs first evolve? How did the growth strategies of 
      the earliest known dinosaurs compare with those of other tetrapods in their 
      ecosystems? We studied femoral bone histology of an array of early dinosaurs 
      alongside that of non-dinosaurian contemporaries from the Ischigualasto Formation 
      in order to test whether the oldest known dinosaurs exhibited novel growth 
      strategies. Our results indicate that the Ischigualasto vertebrate fauna 
      collectively exhibits relatively high growth rates. Dinosaurs are among the 
      fastest growing taxa in the sample, but they occupied this niche alongside 
      crocodylomorphs, archosauriformes, and large-bodied pseudosuchians. 
      Interestingly, these dinosaurs grew at least as quickly, but more continuously 
      than sauropodomorph and theropod dinosaurs of the later Mesozoic. These data 
      suggest that, while elevated growth rates were ancestral for Dinosauria and 
      likely played a significant role in dinosaurs' ascent within Mesozoic ecosystems, 
      they did not set them apart from their contemporaries.

LID - e0246620
AB  - Dzharatitanis kingi gen. et sp. nov. is based on an isolated anterior caudal 
      vertebra (USNM 538127) from the Upper Cretaceous (Turonian) Bissekty Formation at 
      Dzharakuduk, Uzbekistan. Phylogenetic analysis places the new taxon within the 
      diplodocoid clade Rebbachisauridae. This is the first rebbachisaurid reported 
      from Asia and one of the youngest rebbachisaurids in the known fossil record. The 
      caudal is characterized by a slightly opisthocoelous centrum, 'wing-like' 
      transverse processes with large but shallow PRCDF and POCDF, and the absence of a 
      hyposphenal ridge and of TPRL and TPOL. The neural spine has high SPRL, SPDL, 
      SPOL, and POSL and is pneumatized. The apex of neural spine is transversely 
      expanded and bears triangular lateral processes. The new taxon shares with 
      Demandasaurus and the Wessex rebbachisaurid a high SPDL on the lateral side of 
      the neural spine, separated from SPRL and SPOL. This possibly suggests derivation 
      of Dzharatitanis from European rebbachisaurids. This is the second sauropod group 
      identified in the assemblage of non-avian dinosaurs from the Bissekty Formation, 
      in addition to a previously identified indeterminate titanosaurian.

TI  - Dinosaur Metabolism and the Allometry of Maximum Growth Rate.

AB  - The allometry of maximum somatic growth rate has been used in prior studies to 
      classify the metabolic state of both extant vertebrates and dinosaurs. The most 
      recent such studies are reviewed, and their data is reanalyzed. The results of 
      allometric regressions on growth rate are shown to depend on the choice of 
      independent variable; the typical choice used in prior studies introduces a 
      geometric shear transformation that exaggerates the statistical power of the 
      regressions. The maximum growth rates of extant groups are found to have a great 
      deal of overlap, including between groups with endothermic and ectothermic 
      metabolism. Dinosaur growth rates show similar overlap, matching the rates found 
      for mammals, reptiles and fish. The allometric scaling of growth rate with mass 
      is found to have curvature (on a log-log scale) for many groups, contradicting 
      the prevailing view that growth rate allometry follows a simple power law. 
      Reanalysis shows that no correlation between growth rate and basal metabolic rate 
      (BMR) has been demonstrated. These findings drive a conclusion that growth rate 
      allometry studies to date cannot be used to determine dinosaur metabolism as has 
      been previously argued.

AB  - Sauropodomorph dinosaurs dominated the herbivorous niches during the first 40 
      million years of dinosaur history (Late Triassic-Early Jurassic), yet 
      palaeobiological factors that influenced their evolutionary success are not fully 
      understood. For instance, knowledge on their behaviour is limited, although 
      herding in sauropodomorphs has been well documented in derived sauropods from the 
      Late Jurassic and Cretaceous. Here we report an exceptional fossil occurrence 
      from Patagonia that includes over 100 eggs and skeletal specimens of 80 
      individuals of the early sauropodomorph Mussaurus patagonicus, ranging from 
      embryos to fully-grown adults, with an Early Jurassic age as determined by 
      high-precision U-Pb zircon geochronology. Most specimens were found in a 
      restricted area and stratigraphic interval, with some articulated skeletons 
      grouped in clusters of individuals of approximately the same age. Our new 
      discoveries indicate the presence of social cohesion throughout life and 
      age-segregation within a herd structure, in addition to colonial nesting 
      behaviour. These findings provide the earliest evidence of complex social 
      behaviour in Dinosauria, predating previous records by at least 40 My. The 
      presence of sociality in different sauropodomorph lineages suggests a possible 
      Triassic origin of this behaviour, which may have influenced their early success 
      as large terrestrial herbivores.

AB  - Dinosaurs diversified in two steps during the Triassic. They originated about 
      245 Ma, during the recovery from the Permian-Triassic mass extinction, and then 
      remained insignificant until they exploded in diversity and ecological importance 
      during the Late Triassic. Hitherto, this Late Triassic explosion was poorly 
      constrained and poorly dated. Here we provide evidence that it followed the 
      Carnian Pluvial Episode (CPE), dated to 234-232 Ma, a time when climates switched 
      from arid to humid and back to arid again. Our evidence comes from a combined 
      analysis of skeletal evidence and footprint occurrences, and especially from the 
      exquisitely dated ichnofaunas of the Italian Dolomites. These provide evidence of 
      tetrapod faunal compositions through the Carnian and Norian, and show that 
      dinosaur footprints appear exactly at the time of the CPE. We argue then that 
      dinosaurs diversified explosively in the mid Carnian, at a time of major climate 
      and floral change and the extinction of key herbivores, which the dinosaurs 
      opportunistically replaced.

AB  - The interrelationships of the three major dinosaur clades (Theropoda, 
      Sauropodomorpha, and Ornithischia) have come under increased scrutiny following 
      the recovery of conflicting phylogenies by a large new character matrix and its 
      extensively modified revision. Here, we use tools derived from recent 
      phylogenomic studies to investigate the strength and causes of this conflict. 
      Using maximum likelihood as an overarching framework, we examine the global 
      support for alternative hypotheses as well as the distribution of phylogenetic 
      signal among individual characters in both the original and rescored dataset. We 
      find the three possible ways of resolving the relationships among the main 
      dinosaur lineages (Saurischia, Ornithischiformes, and Ornithoscelida) to be 
      statistically indistinguishable and supported by nearly equal numbers of 
      characters in both matrices. While the changes made to the revised matrix 
      increased the mean phylogenetic signal of individual characters, this amplified 
      rather than reduced their conflict, resulting in greater sensitivity to character 
      removal or coding changes and little overall improvement in the ability to 
      discriminate between alternative topologies. We conclude that early dinosaur 
      relationships are unlikely to be resolved without fundamental changes to both the 
      quality of available datasets and the techniques used to analyze them.

AB  - Knowledge about the types of nests built by dinosaurs can provide insight into 
      the evolution of nesting and reproductive behaviors among archosaurs. However, 
      the low preservation potential of their nesting materials and nesting structures 
      means that most information can only be gleaned indirectly through comparison 
      with extant archosaurs. Two general nest types are recognized among living 
      archosaurs: 1) covered nests, in which eggs are incubated while fully covered by 
      nesting material (as in crocodylians and megapodes), and 2) open nests, in which 
      eggs are exposed in the nest and brooded (as in most birds). Previously, dinosaur 
      nest types had been inferred by estimating the water vapor conductance (i.e., 
      diffusive capacity) of their eggs, based on the premise that high conductance 
      corresponds to covered nests and low conductance to open nests. However, a lack 
      of statistical rigor and inconsistencies in this method render its application 
      problematic and its validity questionable. As an alternative we propose a 
      statistically rigorous approach to infer nest type based on large datasets of 
      eggshell porosity and egg mass compiled for over 120 extant archosaur species and 
      29 archosaur extinct taxa/ootaxa. The presence of a strong correlation between 
      eggshell porosity and nest type among extant archosaurs indicates that eggshell 
      porosity can be used as a proxy for nest type, and thus discriminant analyses can 
      help predict nest type in extinct taxa. Our results suggest that: 1) covered 
      nests are likely the primitive condition for dinosaurs (and probably archosaurs), 
      and 2) open nests first evolved among non-avian theropods more derived than 
      Lourinhanosaurus and were likely widespread in non-avian maniraptorans, well 
      before the appearance of birds. Although taphonomic evidence suggests that basal 
      open nesters (i.e., oviraptorosaurs and troodontids) were potentially the first 
      dinosaurs to brood their clutches, they still partially buried their eggs in 
      sediment. Open nests with fully exposed eggs only became widespread among 
      Euornithes. A potential co-evolution of open nests and brooding behavior among 
      maniraptorans may have freed theropods from the ground-based restrictions 
      inherent to covered nests and allowed the exploitation of alternate nesting 
      locations. These changes in nesting styles and behaviors thus may have played a 
      role in the evolutionary success of maniraptorans (including birds).
