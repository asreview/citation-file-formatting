Cellular structure of dinosaur scales reveals retention of reptile-type skin during the evolutionary transition to feathers,"Yang, Z.; Jiang, B.; Xu, J.; McNamara, M.E.","Fossil feathers have transformed our understanding of integumentary evolution in vertebrates. The evolution of feathers is associated with novel skin ultrastructures, but the fossil record of these changes is poor and thus the critical transition from scaled to feathered skin is poorly understood. Here we shed light on this issue using preserved skin in the non-avian feathered dinosaur Psittacosaurus. Skin in the non-feathered, scaled torso is three-dimensionally replicated in silica and preserves epidermal layers, corneocytes and melanosomes. The morphology of the preserved stratum corneum is consistent with an original composition rich in corneous beta proteins, rather than (alpha-) keratins as in the feathered skin of birds. The stratum corneum is relatively thin in the ventral torso compared to extant quadrupedal reptiles, reflecting a reduced demand for mechanical protection in an elevated bipedal stance. The distribution of the melanosomes in the fossil skin is consistent with melanin-based colouration in extant crocodilians. Collectively, the fossil evidence supports partitioning of skin development in Psittacosaurus: a reptile-type condition in non-feathered regions and an avian-like condition in feathered regions. Retention of reptile-type skin in non-feathered regions would have ensured essential skin functions during the early, experimental stages of feather evolution.",2024,,Nature Communications,15,1,,,10.1038/s41467-024-48400-3,,#1,Yang 2024,"",""

A remarkable assemblage of petroglyphs and dinosaur footprints in Northeast Brazil,"Troiano, L.P.; Dos Santos, H.B.; Aureliano, T.; Ghilardi, A.M.","The Serrote do Letreiro Site, found on the northwest periphery of the Sousa Basin, Brazil, presents a remarkable convergence of paleontological and archaeological elements. It is constituted of sub-horizontal ""lajeiros"", or rock outcrops, intermingled with endemic Caatinga vegetation. The three prominent outcrops feature fossilized footprints of theropod, sauropod, and iguanodontian dinosaurs from the Early Cretaceous Period. Adjacent to these dinosaur tracks, indigenous petroglyphs adorn the surface. The petroglyphs, mainly characterized by circular motifs, maintain a striking resemblance to other petroglyphs found in the states of Paraíba and Rio Grande do Norte. This study primarily endeavors to delineate the site's major characteristics while concentrating on the relationship between the dinosaur footprints and the petroglyphs. It concurrently assesses the preservation status of this invaluable record, shedding light on its implications for the realms of paleontology, archaeology, and cultural heritage studies.",2024,,Scientific reports,14,1,6528,,10.1038/s41598-024-56479-3,,#6,Troiano 2024,"",""

A new small duckbilled dinosaur (Hadrosauridae: Lambeosaurinae) from Morocco and dinosaur diversity in the late Maastrichtian of North Africa,"Longrich, N.R.; Pereda-Suberbiola, X.; Bardet, N.; Jalil, N.-E.","In the Late Cretaceous, northern and southern hemispheres evolved distinct dinosaurian faunas. Titanosaurians and abelisaurids dominated the Gondwanan continents; hadrosaurids, ceratopsians and tyrannosaurs dominated North America and Asia. Recently, a lambeosaurine hadrosaurid, Ajnabia odysseus, was reported from the late Maastrichtian phosphates of the Oulad Abdoun Basin Morocco, suggesting dispersal between Laurasia and Gondwana. Here we report new fossils from the phosphates of Morocco showing lambeosaurines achieved high diversity in the late Maastrichtian of North Africa. A skull represents a new dwarf lambeosaurine, Minqaria bata. Minqaria resembles Ajnabia odysseus in size, but differs in the ventrally positioned jugal facet and sinusoidal toothrow. The animal is small, ~ 3.5 m long, but the fused braincase shows it was mature. A humerus and a femur belong to larger hadrosaurids, ~ 6 m long, implying at least three species coexisted. The diversity of hadrosaurids in Europe and Africa suggests a dispersal-driven radiation, with lambeosaurines diversifying to take advantage of low ornithischian diversity. African lambeosaurines are small compared to North American and Asia hadrosaurids however, perhaps due to competition with titanosaurians. Hadrosaurids are unknown from eastern Africa, suggesting Moroccan hadrosaurids may be part of a distinct insular fauna, and represent an island radiation.",2024,,Scientific reports,14,1,3665,,10.1038/s41598-024-53447-9,,#9,Longrich 2024,"",""
A juvenile bird with possible crown-group affinities from a dinosaur-rich Cretaceous ecosystem in North America,"Brownstein, C.D.","BACKGROUND: Living birds comprise the most speciose and anatomically diverse clade of flying vertebrates, but their poor early fossil record and the lack of resolution around the relationships of the major clades have greatly obscured extant avian origins. RESULTS: Here, I describe a Late Cretaceous bird from North America based on a fragmentary skeleton that includes cranial material and portions of the forelimb, hindlimb, and foot and is identified as a juvenile based on bone surface texture. Several features unite this specimen with crown Aves, but its juvenile status precludes the recognition of a distinct taxon. The North American provenance of the specimen supports a cosmopolitan distribution of early crown birds, clashes with the hypothesized southern hemisphere origins of living birds, and demonstrates that crown birds and their closest relatives coexisted with non-avian dinosaurs that independently converged on avian skeletal anatomy, such as the alvarezsaurids and dromaeosaurids. CONCLUSIONS: By revealing the ecological and biogeographic context of Cretaceous birds within or near the crown clade, the Lance Formation specimen provides new insights into the contingent nature of crown avian survival through the Cretaceous-Paleogene mass extinction and the subsequent origins of living bird diversity.",2024,,BMC ecology and evolution,24,1,20,,10.1186/s12862-024-02210-9,,#10,Brownstein 2024,"",""
"Stratigraphic architecture of the Belly River Group (Campanian, Cretaceous) in the plains of southern Alberta: Revisions and updates to an existing model and implications for correlating dinosaur-rich strata","Eberth, D.A.","The Upper Cretaceous (Campanian) Belly River Group (BRG) of southern Alberta has a complex internal stratigraphic architecture derived from differential geometries of its component formations that resulted from regionalized tectonic influences and shifting source areas. A full understanding of BRG architecture has been compromised heretofore by a limited understanding of subsurface data in southwestern- and southeastern-most Alberta. In this study outcrop exposures throughout southern Alberta are tied to reference well logs and subsurface cross-sections allowing a more precise understanding of BRG architecture and how it relates to well-known vertebrate fossil producing areas. Modifications to an existing stratigraphic model of the BRG show that the Oldman and the Dinosaur Park formations have reciprocal north-to-south wedge-shaped geometries and a diachronous contact that become prominently expressed south of Twp 12. The updated model also demonstrates that the Oldman Formation thickens stratigraphically up-section to the south, and that the Foremost-Oldman contact is, essentially, a datum across much of southern Alberta. Identification of the Oldman Formation in the subsurface remains based on its relatively high gamma-ray response in mudstone successions, but it is also recognized that many of its sandstones exhibit relatively low gamma-ray responses like those in underlying and overlying formations. Nomenclature and subdivisions of the Oldman Formation are revised to accommodate this updated understanding, and modifications are also made to the definition of the Judith River-Belly River discontinuity, a newly recognized surface that marks the onset of accommodation and eustatic rise in sea-level in the northern Western Interior Basin at ~76.3 Ma.",2024,,PLoS ONE,19,1 January,,,10.1371/journal.pone.0292318,,#16,Eberth 2024,"",""
Description of a new specimen of Haplocanthosaurus from the Dry Mesa Dinosaur Quarry,"Boisvert, C.; Curtice, B.; Wedel, M.; Wilhite, R.","A new specimen of Haplocanthosaurus is described based on bones excavated from the Late Jurassic Dry Mesa Dinosaur Quarry near Delta, Colorado. The specimen consists of seven dorsal vertebrae and a right tibia and is identified as Haplocanthosaurus based on the dorsally angled transverse processes, tall neural arch peduncles, low parapophyses relative to the diapophyses in the posterior dorsal vertebrae, and the robustness of the tibia combined with a greatly expanded distal articular surface. The discovery adds to our understanding of the biostratigraphy of Haplocanthosaurus, showing this genus is definitively present in the Brushy Basin Member of the Morrison Formation, and making this individual the geologically youngest Haplocanthosaurus specimen on the Colorado Plateau. The identification of this genus adds to the known diversity of sauropods at Dry Mesa Dinosaur Quarry (DMDQ), which is at least six distinct genera, making DMDQ the most diverse single locality of sauropods in the Morrison Formation and the world.",2024,,Anatomical Record,,"(Boisvert C.)

"Reappraisal of sauropod dinosaur diversity in the Upper Cretaceous Winton Formation of Queensland, Australia, through 3D digitisation and description of new specimens","Beeston, S.L.; Poropat, S.F.; Mannion, P.D.; Pentland, A.H.; Enchelmaier, M.J.; Sloan, T.; Elliott, D.A.","Skeletal remains of sauropod dinosaurs have been known from Australia for over 100 years. Unfortunately, the classification of the majority of these specimens to species level has historically been impeded by their incompleteness. This has begun to change in the last 15 years, primarily through the discovery and description of several partial skeletons from the Cenomanian-lower Turonian (lower Upper Cretaceous) Winton Formation in central Queensland, with four species erected to date: Australotitan cooperensis, Diamantinasaurus matildae, Savannasaurus elliottorum, and Wintonotitan wattsi. The first three of these appear to form a clade (Diamantinasauria) of early diverging titanosaurs (or close relatives of titanosaurs), whereas Wintonotitan wattsi is typically recovered as a distantly related non-titanosaurian somphospondylan. Through the use of 3D scanning, we digitised numerous specimens of Winton Formation sauropods, facilitating enhanced comparison between type and referred specimens, and heretofore undescribed specimens. We present new anatomical information on the holotype specimen of Diamantinasaurus matildae, and describe new remains pertaining to twelve sauropod individuals. Firsthand observations and digital analysis enabled previously proposed autapomorphic features of all four named Winton Formation sauropod species to be identified in the newly described specimens, with some specimens exhibiting putative autapomorphies of more than one species, prompting a reassessment of their taxonomic validity. Supported by a specimen-level phylogenetic analysis, we suggest that Australotitan cooperensis is probably a junior synonym of Diamantinasaurus matildae, but conservatively regard it herein as an indeterminate diamantinasaurian, meaning that the Winton Formation sauropod fauna now comprises three (rather than four) valid diamantinasaurian species: Diamantinasaurus matildae, Savannasaurus elliottorum, and Wintonotitan wattsi, with the latter robustly supported as a member of the clade for the first time. We refer some of the newly described specimens to these three species and provide revised diagnoses, with some previously proposed autapomorphies now regarded as diamantinasaurian synapomorphies. Our newly presented anatomical data and critical reappraisal of the Winton Formation sauropods facilitates a more comprehensive understanding of the mid-Cretaceous sauropod palaeobiota of central Queensland.",2024,,PeerJ,12,4,,,10.7717/peerj.17180,,#19,Beeston 2024,"",""
"Digestibility of dinosaur food plants revisited and expanded: Previous data, new taxa, microbe donors, foliage maturity, and seasonality","Howell, M.M.; Gee, C.T.; Böttger, C.; Südekum, K.-H.","Although the living relatives of the Mesozoic flora were once assumed to constitute a nutritionally poor diet for dinosaur herbivores, in vitro fermentation of their foliage has shown that gymnosperms, ferns, and fern relatives can be as highly digestible as angiosperm grasses and dicots. Because nutritional information cannot be preserved in the fossil record, this laboratory approach, first published in 2008, provides a novel alternative to evaluate the digestive quality of the plants that were available to dinosaur megaherbivores such as sauropods. However, very few further studies have since been conducted to supplement and confirm the high fermentative capacity of nonangiospermous taxa. Here we show that the living relatives of the Araucariaceae and Equistaceae are consistently highly digestible, even between taxa and when influenced by environmental and biological factors, while fern taxa are inconsistent on the family level. These results reinforce previous findings about the high energetic potential of Jurassic-age plant families. Fourteen species of fern and gymnosperm foliage from five Jurassic families were collected in the spring and fall, then analyzed for their digestibility using the in vitro Hohenheim gas test. Equisetum, Araucaria, and Angiopteris were the most digestible genera in both seasons, while Agathis, Wollemia, and Marattia were the least digestible. The season in which specimens were collected was found to have to a significant effect on gas production in four out of 16 samples (P < 0.05). Furthermore, leaf maturity influences digestibility in Marattia attenuata (P < 0.05), yet not in Cyathea cooperi (P = 0.24). Finally, the species of the rumen fluid donor did not influence digestibility (P = 0.74). With the original data set supplemented by one new genus and four species, this study confirms and expands previous results about the nutritional capacity of the living relatives of the Jurassic flora.",2023,,PLoS ONE,18,12 December,,,10.1371/journal.pone.0291058,,#20,Howell 2023,"",""
