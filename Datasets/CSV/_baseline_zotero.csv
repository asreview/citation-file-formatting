The evolution of feathers is associated with novel skin ultrastructures, but the fossil record of these changes is poor and thus the critical transition from scaled to feathered skin is poorly understood. Here we shed light on this issue using preserved skin in the non-avian feathered dinosaur Psittacosaurus. Skin in the non-feathered, scaled torso is three-dimensionally replicated in silica and preserves epidermal layers, corneocytes and melanosomes. The morphology of the preserved stratum corneum is consistent with an original composition rich in corneous beta proteins, rather than (alpha-) keratins as in the feathered skin of birds. The stratum corneum is relatively thin in the ventral torso compared to extant quadrupedal reptiles, reflecting a reduced demand for mechanical protection in an elevated bipedal stance. The distribution of the melanosomes in the fossil skin is consistent with melanin-based colouration in extant crocodilians. Collectively, the fossil evidence supports partitioning of skin development in Psittacosaurus: a reptile-type condition in non-feathered regions and an avian-like condition in feathered regions. Retention of reptile-type skin in non-feathered regions would have ensured essential skin functions during the early, experimental stages of feather evolution.","2024","2024-08-15 08:09:33","2024-08-15 08:09:33","","","","1","15","","Nat.

Among these, the South American fossil record contains diverse abelisaurids, arguably the most successful groups of carnivorous dinosaurs from Gondwana in the Cretaceous, reaching their highest diversity towards the end of this period. Here we describe Koleken inakayali gen. et sp. n., a new abelisaurid from the La Colonia Formation (Maastrichtian, Upper Cretaceous) of Patagonia. Koleken inakayali is known from several skull bones, an almost complete dorsal series, complete sacrum, several caudal vertebrae, pelvic girdle and almost complete hind limbs. The new abelisaurid shows a unique set of features in the skull and several anatomical differences from Carnotaurus sastrei (the only other abelisaurid known from the La Colonia Formation). Koleken inakayali is retrieved as a brachyrostran abelisaurid, clustered with other South American abelisaurids from the latest Cretaceous (Campanian-Maastrichtian), such as Aucasaurus, Niebla and Carnotaurus. Leveraging our phylogeny estimates, we explore rates of morphological evolution across ceratosaurian lineages, finding them to be particularly high for elaphrosaurine noasaurids and around the base of Abelisauridae, before the Early Cretaceous radiation of the latter clade. The Noasauridae and their sister clade show contrasting patterns of morphological evolution, with noasaurids undergoing an early phase of accelerated evolution of the axial and hind limb skeleton in the Jurassic, and the abelisaurids exhibiting sustained high rates of cranial evolution during the Early Cretaceous. These results provide much needed context for the evolutionary dynamics of ceratosaurian theropods, contributing to broader understanding of macroevolutionary patterns across dinosaurs.","2024","2024-08-15 08:09:33","2024-08-15 08:09:33","","307-356","","3","40","","Cladistics","","","","","","","","English","","","Medline","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/cla.12583","phylogeny; animal; classification; skull; dinosaur; evolution; fossil; Argentina","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One example involves basal loricatans which are non-crocodylomorph pseudosuchians traditionally known as “rauisuchians.” Their large size (5–8+ m long) and morphological similarities to post-Triassic theropod dinosaurs, including dorsoventrally deep skulls and serrated dentitions, suggest basal loricatans were apex predators. However, this hypothesis does not consider functional behaviors that can influence more refined roles of predators in their environment, for example, degree of carcass utilization. Here, we apply finite element analysis to a juvenile but three-dimensionally well-preserved cranium of the basal loricatan Saurosuchus galilei to investigate its functional morphology and to compare with stress distributions from the theropod Allosaurus fragilis to assess degrees of functional convergence between Triassic and post-Triassic carnivores. We find similar stress distributions and magnitudes between the two study taxa under the same functional simulations, indicating that Saurosuchus had a somewhat strong skull and thus exhibited some degree of functional convergence with theropods. However, Saurosuchus also had a weak bite for an animal of its size (1015–1885 N) that is broadly equivalent to the bite force of modern gharials (Gavialis gangeticus). We infer that Saurosuchus potentially avoided tooth–bone interactions and consumed the softer parts of carcasses, unlike theropods and other basal loricatans. This deduced feeding mode for Saurosuchus increases the known functional diversity of basal loricatans and highlights functional differences between Triassic and post-Triassic apex predators.","2024","2024-08-15 08:09:33","2024-08-15 08:09:33","","549-565","","3","307","","Anat.

Titanosaurians and abelisaurids dominated the Gondwanan continents; hadrosaurids, ceratopsians and tyrannosaurs dominated North America and Asia. Recently, a lambeosaurine hadrosaurid, Ajnabia odysseus, was reported from the late Maastrichtian phosphates of the Oulad Abdoun Basin Morocco, suggesting dispersal between Laurasia and Gondwana. Here we report new fossils from the phosphates of Morocco showing lambeosaurines achieved high diversity in the late Maastrichtian of North Africa. A skull represents a new dwarf lambeosaurine, Minqaria bata. Minqaria resembles Ajnabia odysseus in size, but differs in the ventrally positioned jugal facet and sinusoidal toothrow. The animal is small, ~ 3.5 m long, but the fused braincase shows it was mature. A humerus and a femur belong to larger hadrosaurids, ~ 6 m long, implying at least three species coexisted. The diversity of hadrosaurids in Europe and Africa suggests a dispersal-driven radiation, with lambeosaurines diversifying to take advantage of low ornithischian diversity. African lambeosaurines are small compared to North American and Asia hadrosaurids however, perhaps due to competition with titanosaurians. Hadrosaurids are unknown from eastern Africa, suggesting Moroccan hadrosaurids may be part of a distinct insular fauna, and represent an island radiation.","2024","2024-08-15 08:09:33","2024-08-15 08:09:33","","3665","","1","14","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","English","","","Medline","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-53447-9","phylogeny; animal; phosphate; skull; dinosaur; fossil; Africa; Morocco","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

RESULTS: Here, I describe a Late Cretaceous bird from North America based on a fragmentary skeleton that includes cranial material and portions of the forelimb, hindlimb, and foot and is identified as a juvenile based on bone surface texture. Several features unite this specimen with crown Aves, but its juvenile status precludes the recognition of a distinct taxon. The North American provenance of the specimen supports a cosmopolitan distribution of early crown birds, clashes with the hypothesized southern hemisphere origins of living birds, and demonstrates that crown birds and their closest relatives coexisted with non-avian dinosaurs that independently converged on avian skeletal anatomy, such as the alvarezsaurids and dromaeosaurids. CONCLUSIONS: By revealing the ecological and biogeographic context of Cretaceous birds within or near the crown clade, the Lance Formation specimen provides new insights into the contingent nature of crown avian survival through the Cretaceous-Paleogene mass extinction and the subsequent origins of living bird diversity.","2024","2024-08-15 08:09:33","2024-08-15 08:09:33","","20","","1","24","","BMC Ecol Evol","","","","","","","","English","","","Medline","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12862-024-02210-9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A full understanding of BRG architecture has been compromised heretofore by a limited understanding of subsurface data in southwestern- and southeastern-most Alberta. In this study outcrop exposures throughout southern Alberta are tied to reference well logs and subsurface cross-sections allowing a more precise understanding of BRG architecture and how it relates to well-known vertebrate fossil producing areas. Modifications to an existing stratigraphic model of the BRG show that the Oldman and the Dinosaur Park formations have reciprocal north-to-south wedge-shaped geometries and a diachronous contact that become prominently expressed south of Twp 12. The updated model also demonstrates that the Oldman Formation thickens stratigraphically up-section to the south, and that the Foremost-Oldman contact is, essentially, a datum across much of southern Alberta. Identification of the Oldman Formation in the subsurface remains based on its relatively high gamma-ray response in mudstone successions, but it is also recognized that many of its sandstones exhibit relatively low gamma-ray responses like those in underlying and overlying formations. Nomenclature and subdivisions of the Oldman Formation are revised to accommodate this updated understanding, and modifications are also made to the definition of the Judith River-Belly River discontinuity, a newly recognized surface that marks the onset of accommodation and eustatic rise in sea-level in the northern Western Interior Basin at ~76.3 Ma.","2024","2024-08-15 08:09:33","2024-08-15 08:09:33","","","","1 January","19","","PLoS ONE","","","","","","","","English","","","Embase","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0292318","article; nonhuman; Alberta; environment; geometry; nomenclature; dinosaur; fossil; Cretaceous; Campanian; gamma radiation; geographic and geological phenomena; geology; plains; river; sedimentology; stratigraphic model; vertebrate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
