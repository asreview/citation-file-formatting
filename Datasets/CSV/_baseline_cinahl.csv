"Osteohistological insight into the growth dynamics of early dinosaurs and their contemporaries.","Curry Rogers, Kristina; Martínez, Ricardo N.; Colombi, Carina; Rogers, Raymond R.; Alcober, Oscar","PLoS ONE",="19326203",,="4/3/2024","19","4","1","60","176404503","10.1371/journal.pone.0298242","Public Library of Science","Article","FEMUR; DINOSAURS; MASS extinctions; BODY size; RESPIRATION; MESOZOIC Era; TETRAPODS; ARGENTINA",,"Dinosauria debuted on Earth's stage in the aftermath of the Permo-Triassic Mass Extinction Event, and survived two other Triassic extinction intervals to eventually dominate terrestrial ecosystems. More than 231 million years ago, in the Upper Triassic Ischigualasto Formation of west-central Argentina, dinosaurs were just getting warmed up. At this time, dinosaurs represented a minor fraction of ecosystem diversity. Members of other tetrapod clades, including synapsids and pseudosuchians, shared convergently evolved features related to locomotion, feeding, respiration, and metabolism and could have risen to later dominance. However, it was Dinosauria that radiated in the later Mesozoic most significantly in terms of body size, diversity, and global distribution. Elevated growth rates are one of the adaptations that set later Mesozoic dinosaurs apart, particularly from their contemporary crocodilian and mammalian compatriots. When did the elevated growth rates of dinosaurs first evolve? How did the growth strategies of the earliest known dinosaurs compare with those of other tetrapods in their ecosystems? We studied femoral bone histology of an array of early dinosaurs alongside that of non-dinosaurian contemporaries from the Ischigualasto Formation in order to test whether the oldest known dinosaurs exhibited novel growth strategies. Our results indicate that the Ischigualasto vertebrate fauna collectively exhibits relatively high growth rates. Dinosaurs are among the fastest growing taxa in the sample, but they occupied this niche alongside crocodylomorphs, archosauriformes, and large-bodied pseudosuchians. Interestingly, these dinosaurs grew at least as quickly, but more continuously than sauropodomorph and theropod dinosaurs of the later Mesozoic. These data suggest that, while elevated growth rates were ancestral for Dinosauria and likely played a significant role in dinosaurs' ascent within Mesozoic ecosystems, they did not set them apart from their contemporaries.

"Diving dinosaurs? Caveats on the use of bone compactness and pFDA for inferring lifestyle.","Myhrvold, Nathan P.; Baumgart, Stephanie L.; Vidal, Daniel; Fish, Frank E.; Henderson, Donald M.; Saitta, Evan T.; Sereno, Paul C.","PLoS ONE",="19326203",,="3/6/2024","19","3","1","79","175875899","10.1371/journal.pone.0298957","Public Library of Science","Article","DINOSAURS; DISCRIMINANT analysis; DATA distribution; MEASUREMENT errors; BODIES of water; RIB cage",,"The lifestyle of spinosaurid dinosaurs has been a topic of lively debate ever since the unveiling of important new skeletal parts for Spinosaurus aegyptiacus in 2014 and 2020. Disparate lifestyles for this taxon have been proposed in the literature; some have argued that it was semiaquatic to varying degrees, hunting fish from the margins of water bodies, or perhaps while wading or swimming on the surface; others suggest that it was a fully aquatic underwater pursuit predator. The various proposals are based on equally disparate lines of evidence. A recent study by Fabbri and coworkers sought to resolve this matter by applying the statistical method of phylogenetic flexible discriminant analysis to femur and rib bone diameters and a bone microanatomy metric called global bone compactness. From their statistical analyses of datasets based on a wide range of extant and extinct taxa, they concluded that two spinosaurid dinosaurs (S. aegyptiacus, Baryonyx walkeri) were fully submerged ""subaqueous foragers,"" whereas a third spinosaurid (Suchomimus tenerensis) remained a terrestrial predator. We performed a thorough reexamination of the datasets, analyses, and methodological assumptions on which those conclusions were based, which reveals substantial problems in each of these areas. In the datasets of exemplar taxa, we found unsupported categorization of taxon lifestyle, inconsistent inclusion and exclusion of taxa, and inappropriate choice of taxa and independent variables. We also explored the effects of uncontrolled sources of variation in estimates of bone compactness that arise from biological factors and measurement error. We found that the ability to draw quantitative conclusions is limited when taxa are represented by single data points with potentially large intrinsic variability. The results of our analysis of the statistical method show that it has low accuracy when applied to these datasets and that the data distributions do not meet fundamental assumptions of the method. These findings not only invalidate the conclusions of the particular analysis of Fabbri et al. but also have important implications for future quantitative uses of bone compactness and discriminant analysis in paleontology.

Other sedimentary structures have been repeatedly mistaken for tracks, including other trace fossils such as arthropod tracks, burrows and fish feeding traces; erosional features; and human-made traces. We here review instances of difficult, ambiguous, or controversial cases that have been discussed in the literature. We then discuss four main criteria for the verification of tetrapod tracks: (1) preservation of regular trackway morphology, (2) preservation of track morphology, (3) deformation structures (best seen in cross-section) and (4) the temporal or environmental context. Of these criteria, criterion 1 is the most unambiguous and has rarely been challenged. We apply these criteria to a new site located within the city of Al-Bireh, Palestine, which belongs to the Lower Cretaceous (Albian) Soreq Formation. The site preserves a surface with many indistinct depressions that lack anatomical detail. Two unequivocal trackways are identified per criterion 1, demonstrating the first known occurrence of dinosaur fossils in Palestine. The tracksite is part of the late Lower Cretaceous carbonate platform of the eastern Levant, demonstrating temporal emergence of the platform above sea level and a connection to the mainland.

Although these methods have become increasingly popular, only a small number of dinosaurs have been studied using these techniques, which require exceptional preservation of fossil feathers, leaving open key questions such as whether dinosaurs changed their plumage patterns during ontogeny. Here we reconstruct the feather colouration of an approximately one-year-old individual of the Early Cretaceous dromaeosaurid theropod Wulong bohaiensis, which to our knowledge is the first unequivocal juvenile paravian for which aspects of the original colour has been predicted. Using quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) and multinomial logistic regression (MLR) on the most comprehensive available datasets, we find strong evidence for iridescent plumage of the forelimb and hindlimb remiges and grey plumage on other portions of the body. This suggests that some juvenile paravians used shiny iridescent feathers for signalling purposes, possibly even before reaching somatic or sexual maturity, and thus we can conclude that this paravian used iridescent signalling for intraspecific communication other than sexual signalling. Finally, our results show that when analysing fossil datasets that are entirely comprised of solid and cylindrical melanosomes QDA consistently outperforms MLR, providing more accurate and higher classification probability colour predictions.

By corollary, where large and small herbivores coexisted over a geologically significant period of time, they must have exhibited niche partitioning. We use multivariate ecomorphological analysis of the Late Cretaceous ornithischian dinosaur assemblage of North America to examine this prediction. Our results indicate good ecomorphological separation of most, but not all, species at small body size, although more work is required to demonstrate that these patterns were adaptive. Calculation of browse profiles using corrected abundance data and bracketed estimates of energy requirements suggests that immature megaherbivores – most particularly hadrosaurids – outstripped coexisting small ornithischian species in their control of the resource base.

Because their remains are rare and often fragmentary, caenagnathid diversity is poorly understood. Anzu wyliei is the only caenagnathid species currently described from the late Maastrichtian Hell Creek Formation of the USA and is also among the largest and most completely preserved North American caenagnathids. Smaller, less complete caenagnathid material has long been known from the Hell Creek Formation, but it is unclear whether these are juvenile representatives of Anzu or if they represent distinct, unnamed taxa. Here, we describe a relatively small caenagnathid hindlimb from the Hell Creek Formation, and conduct osteohistological analysis to assess its maturity. Histological data and morphological differences from Anzu wyliei and other caenagnathids allow us to conclude that this specimen represents a new species of caenagnathid from the Hell Creek Formation, with a smaller adult body size than Anzu. This new taxon is also distinct from other small caenagnathid material previously described from the area, potentially indicating the coexistence of three distinct caenagnathid species in the Hell Creek Formation. These results show that caenagnathid diversity in the Hell Creek ecosystem has been underestimated.

Prior to, or soon after hatching, these membranes detach from the animal leaving a temporary or permanent umbilical scar (umbilicus) equivalent to the navel or 'belly button' in some placental mammals, including humans. Although ubiquitous in modern mammals and reptiles (including birds), at least early in their ontogeny, the umbilicus has not been identified in any pre-Cenozoic amniote. Results: We report the oldest preserved umbilicus in a fossil amniote from a ~130-million-year-old early-branching ceratopsian dinosaur, Psittacosaurus. Under laser-stimulated fluorescence (LSF), the umbilicus is revealed as an elongate midline structure delimited by a row of paired scales on the abdomen. The relatively late ontogenetic stage (close to sexual maturity) estimated for the individual indicates that the umbilicus was probably retained throughout life. Conclusions: Unlike most extant reptiles and birds that lose this scar within days to weeks after hatching, the umbilicus of Psittacosaurus persisted at least until sexual maturity, similar to some lizards and crocodylians with which it shares the closest morphological resemblance. This discovery is the oldest record of an amniote umbilicus and the first in a non-avian dinosaur. However, given the variability of this structure in extant reptilian analogues, a persistent umbilical scar may not have been present in all non-avian dinosaurs.

Their taxonomy has proven to be especially problematic. Recent discoveries from Western Europe in general, specifically Iberia, provide some of the best specimens for the understanding of their phylogeny, leading to the description of the spinosaurid Vallibonavenatrix cani and the recognition of the Iberian dinosaur Camarillasaurus cirugedae as one of them. Portuguese associated spinosaurid remains (ML1190) from the Papo Seco Formation (early Barremian) were previously assigned to Baryonyx walkeri but new material recovered in 2020 along with new phylogenetic analyses suggests a different phylogenetic placement, making their revision necessary. Here we show that these remains are not attributable to Baryonyx walkeri, but to a new genus and species, Iberospinus natarioi, gen. et sp. nov. The new taxon is characterized by the presence of a single Meckelian foramen in the Meckelian sulcus, a straight profile of the ventral surface of the dentary and a distal thickening of the acromion process of the pubis between other characters. Iberospinus natarioi is recovered as a sister taxon of the clade formed by Baryonyx and Suchomimus, and outside Spinosaurinae when Vallibonaventrix cani is excluded from the analysis. The description of this taxon reinforces Iberia as a hotspot for spinosaur biodiversity, with several endemic taxa for the region. As expected for the clade, the dentary displays a highly vascularized neurovascular network. The morphometric analysis of parts of the skeleton (pedal phalanx and caudal vertebrae, among others) shows an intermediate condition between basal tetanurans and spinosaurines.

The dinosaur fauna of the type locality of Cerro Fortaleza Formation is known from -and biased to- large-sized sauropod remains and a single described taxon, the titanosaur Dreadnoughtus schrani. Here, we report the taxonomic composition of a site preserving thirteen isolated teeth and several osteoderms belonging to three dinosaur clades (Abelisauridae, Titanosauria, and Nodosauridae), and at least one clade of notosuchian crocodyliforms (Peirosauridae). They come from sediments positioned at the mid-section of the Cerro Fortaleza Formation, which is Campanian-Maastrichtian in age, adding valuable information to the abundance and biodiversity of this Cretaceous ecosystem. Since non-titanosaur dinosaur bones are almost absent in the locality, the teeth presented here provide a window onto the archosaur biodiversity of the Late Cretaceous in southern Patagonia. The nodosaurid tooth and small armor ossicles represent the first record of ankylosaurs for this stratigraphic unit. The peirosaurid material also represents the most austral record of the clade in South America.

Einiosaurus procurvicornis is known from at least 15 individuals recovered from two monospecific bonebeds, while Achelousaurus horneri is primarily known from one articulated adult cranium as well as two isolated subadult individuals previously referred to the taxon. Previous assessments of ontogeny in these taxa, alongside closely related centrosaurines, focused primarily on crania of mature individuals and disarticulated elements of immature individuals. Here we describe an articulated subadult Einiosaurus procurvicornis skull (MOR 456 8-8-87-1) from the Einiosaurus procurvicornis type locality bonebed and compare its cranial ornamental development with the only identically sized articulated subadult eucentrosauran skull from the Two Medicine Formation, MOR 591. These individuals represent the only known articulated subadult skulls from the hypothesized eucentrosauran lineage in the Two Medicine Formation, thereby enabling comparison of early ontogenetic developmental sequence and timing of all three primary cranial ornaments (nasal, supraorbital, and parietosquamosal frill). Comparison indicates that parietosquamosal frill and supraorbital ornamentation development may have preceded nasal horncore development in these taxa. MOR 456 8-8-87-1 fills a gap between the plesiomorphic morphology of juvenile Einiosaurus procurvicornis supraorbital horncores and the rounded, spheroid mass of bone which characterizes adults. The complete left squamosal of MOR 456 8-8-87-1 is of adult size, in contrast to its shorter face and immature facial ornamentation, which suggests that in Einiosaurus procurvicornis, the face and facial ornamentation development occurred after the parietosquamosal frill had reached adult size.
